      <description>"Allomancy is brutal, raw, and powerful"

- Khriss in "On the Three Metallic Arts"

Allomancy is the most widely used form of Investiture on Scadrial, and is locally known as one of the three Metallic Arts. People who have one or more Allomantic abilities are called Allomancers with each Allomantic power being paired with a type of metal, which must be ingested and "burned" to activate.</description>

      <description>Atium is a God Metal. An Allomancer burning atium is able to see into the future by a few seconds. Feruchemists can use atium to store youthfulness, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, atium steals any property or power. The metal is a reflective, silvery color, so much so that beads of atium almost appear to be drops of liquid.

Atium is notable as it is the condensed power of the Shard Ruin. As a result, an Allomancer burning atium does not draw on Preservation's power; instead, the Investiture of the metal provides the power. It was sequestered away at the Pits of Hathsin by Preservation when the latter gave up his mind to trap Ruin.

Presumably, the name "atium" is inherited from Ati, the name of the original holder of the Shard Ruin, just as the name "lerasium" is inherited from Leras, the original holder of the Shard Preservation. Atium cannot be combined with lerasium to make harmonium, nor can harmonium be broken down into atium and lerasium. While it would not be possible to get atium and lerasium from harmonium through distillation or other mundane methods, it may be possible through some other method.</description>

      <description>Count Ahan is an Arelene merchant from Sel. He is very fat and has an air of arrogance about him, not seeming to take much seriously. He is impetuous to a fault, often speaking and acting without thinking.

Following the Reod, Ahan rose to prominence in Iadon's income-based meritocracy gaining the title of count. Where his fortune falls within the Arelon system is unknown but is no higher than fourth. He shares a friendly rivalry with Duke Roial and is constantly trying to either outdo or oppose him. Ahan, along with Roial and several others, is part of Sarene's opposition to Iadon's rule, and resistance to Hrathen's efforts to convert Arelon. Ahan has one daughter, Torena, who is courted by Shuden.

Shortly after Telrii seizes control of Arelon in the wake of Iadon's death, Ahan betrays the group of resisters in an effort to finally best his long-time rival. Things take a turn for the unexpected when Roial is killed for treason. Ahan never recovers from the guilt of his betrayal. He loses much of his weight, and thereafter only speaks in a dazed, sickly voice.</description>

      <description>Beldre is a half-skaa and half-noble Coinshot from Urteau on Scadrial.

She is Quellion's sister. She has deep auburn hair, green eyes and is described by Spook as being able to wear a skaa dress with "striking elegance". Beldre is naive and trusting, and is aware of these traits. She also demonstrates her inexperience when she shows up alone at Spook's hideout.

Beldre does not especially like confrontation, but will stand up for what she believes is right. When Spook first causes a scene during one of Quellion's speeches, she uses her Allomancy to stop him from killing one of the guards with a sword, although Spook assumes that Quellion is the Coinshot.

She later reveals herself as a Coinshot when defending her brother from Spook's Ruin-influenced attempt at murder.

She has a relationship with Spook after the Catacendre.</description>

      <description>"BioChroma is the power of life, and so it seeks patterns of life."

- Vasher

Awakening is a manifestation of Investiture on Nalthis. It is the art of combining color, BioChromatic Breath ("Breath"), and an Awakening Command in order to animate an object, resulting in one of four types of BioChromatic entities. It was discovered approximately 400 years before the Pahn Kahl rebellion.

The process of Awakening begins when an Awakener releases some of their stored Breath into an object through the use of a Command. While doing so, the Awakener must also be in physical contact with a source of color (e.g. a piece of dyed cloth). If the Command is valid and is correctly visualized in the Awakener's mind, then color is drained from the color source and the target object becomes Awakened. It then proceeds to carry out the Command. If the command is invalid or not visualized properly, the object can still be Awakened but will have no effect.</description>

- The Words of Founding

Adonalsium is a mysterious being or force in the cosmere from which all Investiture is derived. It is unknown whether the term Adonalsium is a name or title. Adonalsium is generally regarded as a God, responsible for the creation of the cosmere, and it is sometimes referred to as the "power of creation." In a pivotal moment in the history of the cosmere, an event known as the Shattering, a group of individuals conspired against and killed Adonalsium. Upon its death the power was broken into sixteen Shards which were all seized by some of the individuals present. These Shards each bear an aspect of Adonalsium's nature.

The events on Yolen surrounding the Shattering of Adonalsium will be addressed in Dragonsteel.</description>

- Laral

Alethkar is the largest and most prominent of the five Vorin nations on Roshar. People from Alethkar are known as Alethi, and their royal colors are blue and gold. Prior to the True Desolation, they were engaged in the War of Reckoning against the listeners. At the present, the vast majority of their territory is under control of the Voidbringers.</description>

      <description>The Ashmounts were enormous volcanoes in the Final Empire.

They were created by Rashek during his initial contact with the Well of Ascension to counteract his moving the planet too close to the sun. They are the source of the ashfalls which protect the planet from overheating by filling the air with massive clouds of ash. Aluminum found on Scadrial came from the Ashmounts' craters.

While Ruin was free, he caused the Ashmounts to emit massively larger amounts of ash than previous times as part of his plan to destroy the world.

During Sazed's Ascension, he restored Scadrial to its original orbit, eliminating the need for the ashmounts.</description>

      <description>The Chasm is a major geographical feature of the Arelon region of the planet Sel.

The chasm was the cause of the Reod. The chasm came about by unnatural events.

Because the chasm changed the landscape of Arelon significantly, it also changed how Aons needed to be drawn.

The chasm is unlikely to have been caused by Odium's visit to Sel. The Reod occurred about ten years before Elantris, while Odium's visit came far earlier than that (at least several centuries, as seons did not exist before Odium appeared).</description>

      <description>Aons are a writing system used by the Aonic peoples of Arelon and Teod on Sel. They are logographic, meaning they represent words and meanings, as opposed to an alphabet which represents sounds. Instead of being an invented system like most scripts, the Aons already existed and were discovered through trial and error.

Aons also serve as the focus for the magic system AonDor used by Elantrians. This, presumably, served as the impetus for the discovering of new Aons.

Aons were all referred to as “Aon insert name here” such as Aon Rao or Aon Ene. They were disyllabic with two hard vowels.

It is also possible to combine Aons, resulting in strengthened or combined powers. However, it is incredibly difficult to combine or convert Aons with other types of Investiture. This is speculated to be because Aons rely so heavily on geography for their power, and would therefore have to be completely recreated in order to be used anywhere other than Arelon and surrounding areas.

There is one Seon for each Aon, which glows visibly at the Seon's core. Not all Aons have been revealed.

All Aons are based on Aon Aon, which itself was based off the shape of Arelon. The straight horizontal line at the top represented the northern coastline; the curve to the right, the Atad Mountains; the dot in the center, Lake Alonoe. All Aons shown below are pre-Reod and are thus incomplete since the chasm line to the bottom right of the Aon is not present. <div style="float:left; padding-right:1em"></description>

      <description>Bridge Four is the name of a group headed by Kaladin Stormblessed, an Alethi Knight Radiant of the Order of Windrunners. The group was originally one of the bridge crews of the Sadeas warcamp in the Shattered Plains, hence the name, but its function has evolved over time, becoming both Dalinar Kholin's honor guard as well as a military unit within a battalion of the Kholin army, then later becoming a group largely consisting of Kaladin's squires and Knights Radiant loyal to him. Despite such drastic changes, the members still refer to themselves by their original bridge crew name, and have even kept their old bridge with them.

Their insignia, designed by Kaladin, is made up of the glyph vev (meaning the number four) suspended above the glyph gesheh (meaning bridge), stylized as a bridge spanning a chasm.</description>

      <description>The Beggars' Feast is an Alethi tradition.

At each occasion, the host duplicates the feast and invite the poorest of people to share in their revelry.

In Alethkar, it is tradition at any banquet of the king to also feed the less fortunate. The Feast is held in a separate room in which any poor people may attend and eat the same as a the king and his guests.

Szeth walked through the Beggar's Feast on his way to assassinate Gavilar. While there, he witnesses a seemingly drunken old beggar speaking gibberish. The old beggar is the Herald Jezrien whom Dalinar visits when he needs alcohol.

The Beggars' Feast is cancelled by Queen Aesudan during the War of Reckoning.</description>

      <description>Aona was the original Vessel of the Shard Devotion. Sometime after the Shattering, she and Skai took up residence on Sel. Edgli believes that, by doing so, they violated the original Vessels' pact to not settle on the same world as another Shard, though the exact terms of that agreement are somewhat unclear.

Sometime in the distant past, Odium arrived on Sel and attacked both her and Skai, killing both of them and Splintering their Shards. At the time, he was hunting Ambition, but found them first, and likely used their alleged violation of the Vessels' pact as justification for killing them. After Aona and Skai died, Odium locked much of Devotion and Dominion's power in the Cognitive Realm to prevent them from gaining another Vessel, which makes the Cognitive Realm around Sel very dangerous.

On present-day Sel, while most of her power remains trapped in the Cognitive Realm, some of it is in the Aons at the center of seons, which are Splinters of Devotion. There also appears to still be a perpendicularity tied to her, which takes the form of a round pool filled with blue liquid located on a mountain near Elantris. When Raoden enters the pool, he hears a voice, which may be that of Aona's Cognitive Shadow, though whether or not she even has a Cognitive Shadow is unknown.</description>

      <description>The religion of the Cazzi people, (unnamed, but possibly Cazzism), is a religion in Classical Scadrial.

The Cazzi are a people familiar with death, and death chants are among their beliefs. These chants are believed by the Cazzi to help free the spirits of the dead from their corpses, allowing them to return to the "mountain of souls". The Lord Ruler modeled the lives of the Skaa after the Cazzi.

Sazed quietly chants a Cazzi death chant in the lair formerly held by Camon while investigating the aftermath of an attack by a Steel Inquisitor.

Sazed used Cazzi teachings about the body to restore humans to their pre-ascension form.</description>

      <description>The Arguois caverns were a system of caves in the Central Dominance of the Final Empire on Scadrial.

The caverns were used by the skaa rebellion to house and train their armies. Skaa rebels and refugees went there to hide, as did the skaa from Tresting plantation after Kelsier killed Themos Tresting. Later on, when Kelsier raised an army for the skaa rebellion to overthrow The Lord Ruler, those men, too, went to the Arguois Caverns to hide and train to become soldiers. Kelsier visited the skaa rebels there.

They are thought to be located between near the Pits of Hathsin and the kandra Homeland.

They were used during Sazed's ascension as a place of safety, similar to the storage caches Rashek left under the control of the Steel Ministry.</description>

      <description>The bridge crews, crewed by men known as the bridgemen, were originally an expendable workforce used for hard labor and cannon fodder. They later become an infantry battalion, but retain the name "bridge crews" as their official unit name.

Under Highprince Torol Sadeas, the bridge crews carry large, heavy bridges in order to allow his soldiers to cross the chasms of the Shattered Plains. The bridgemen consist mainly of slaves, deserters, thieves, foreigners, and some men who joined because they had nowhere else to go. The bridgemen were treated as expendable and incurred heavy casualties with every bridge run.

The bridge crews are later transferred to the control of Highprince Dalinar Kholin, where they become a battalion of soldiers in Kholin's army. In this capacity, they are commanded by Captain Kaladin Stormblessed, with Bridge Four as its premier unit and headquarters.</description>

King Eventeo of Teod, faced with the death of his daughter Sarene, capitulates to the demands of Dilaf and agrees to the full surrender of Teod to the armies of the Fjordell Empire.

Dilaf, Hrathen and Sarene are transported to Eventeo's throne room by the sacrifice of some of his monks. Hrathen and Sarene escape, and are pursued through the city by Dilaf.

Raoden arrives in Teoras and is nearly defeated by Dilaf, until Hrathen uses Dilaf's own magic against him.

The rest of the Elantrians arrive and battle the troops of Fjordell. Then they all jump back to Elantris.</description>

He swore that Tevidian had fathered a half-breed child, and hunted Vin's half-brother, Reen, to get him to admit it. Reen died promising Vin had starved to death long ago, but Bendal remained convinced one was out there.

After Vin Soothed Prelan Laird for Camon and his crew, Bendal hunted her, to eventually bring the evidence against Tevidian. However, Vin escaped the Canton of Finance Headquarters because Kelsier threw Bendal off Vin's trail.

Bendal was the lead Inquisitor who stopped Kelsier and Vin during their infiltration of Kredik Shaw.

Bendal eventually fought Kelsier at fountain square and was decapitated.</description>

Its roads are unpaved, and its houses are stone-walled, thatched cottages. The royal palace, which serves as a meeting place and a center of operations for the kingdom, is a single-story building with a courtyard of packed dirt; it is, however, large enough to be considered almost "flamboyant." Bevalis is a small city in comparison with the capitals of other nations on Nalthis, with a population of around a few thousand.</description>

      <description>The Battle of Hathsin was a seminal moment in the history of the cosmere, occurring near the cavern system containing the Pits of Hathsin and Kandra Homeland on Scadrial. It was the culmination of the slow war of attrition between the intents of the Shards Preservation and Ruin. It resulted in the near-destruction of Scadrial, the consumption of most of the world's atium, and the subsequent remaking of the planet by Sazed during the Catacendre. It also resulted in the deaths of Elend, Vin, Ati, and many other people.</description>

      <description>Artifabrians are engineers that design and construct fabrials on Roshar. In Vorin nations it is considered a women's profession.

They discover groupings of fabrials, which they name Altering fabrials, Pairing fabrials, and Warning fabrials. Altering and Pairing fabrials are areas of great interest to artifabrians and are the subject of much research and theorizing. Aside from their research, artifabrians also take on the duty of installing new fabrials.

During the War of Reckoning several major breakthroughs have been accomplished by artifabrians, such as the Veden Half-shards. Artifabrians have spent centuries trying to recreate Shardplate, and half-shards are the closest they have come although they operate under a different design scheme.

The methods they use to craft fabrials, including capturing spren in gems, are closely guarded secrets of the artifabrian community. Thaylen artifabrians have a secretive means to precisely adjust the Stormlight within a fabrial.</description>

He meets with Vasher at a restaurant in order to give him information on court politics regarding the movement from a faction in the court to attack Idris. Vasher exerted some sort of influence on Bebid, breaking him, which Bebid believed to have been difficult. He also tells Vasher about Bluefingers when he tells Vasher he is unable to help in his plans, as he moves in the wrong circles to provide the information.</description>

      <description>"Our own natures destroy us. Alakavish was a Surgebinder. He should have known better. And yet, the Nahel bond gave him no more wisdom than a regular man."

- Nohadon on Alakavish and the Nahel bond

Alakavish was a Surgebinder during the time of Nohadon on Roshar. He did not bond an honorspren.

He somehow brought the world to war prior to a Desolation. His powers held a large allure to the common people. Eleven years into the Desolation, some wished to blame Alakavish, thinking that if he hadn't caused a war, the Desolation would not have caused so much damage. Nohadon, however, thought Alakavish was a symptom of a greater disease: that humanity would be torn by war and squabbling, and perhaps deserved to lose against the Voidbringers.</description>

      <description>"There were a group of people before the Ascension known as the Astalsi. They claimed that each person was born with a certain finite amount of ill luck. And so, when an unfortunate event happened, they thought themselves blessed—thereafter, their lives could only get better."

- Sazed preaching to Vin

Astalsi was an ancient religion from Scadrial.

The Astalsi followers were rather advanced, and mixed religion with science. They developed a detailed scale to express different colors, and thought that these different colors were indications of different kinds of fortune.

They believed that each person was born with a certain finite amount of bad luck, and for them a poor life was a sign of fortune yet to come. For this reason Sazed preached the Astalsi religion to Vin, given that Vin already had been through a lot during her life.</description>

      <description>The artisan's script is a form of writing in the nation of Hallandren on Nalthis. Unlike most writing systems, which are based on form and shape, the artisan's script is based on color. Each color represents a different sound in Hallandren's language. In its most basic form, simple dots are used. More advanced writers use lines that gradually shift in color, or glyphs that form pictures.

To use the artisan's script to its full potential requires perfect color recognition granted by the Third Heightening.

The God Kings of Hallandren are taught to communicate with the artisan's script due to the removal of their tongues.</description>

      <description>Allekatrase the Lens-wielder, Alcatraz Smedry the First, was an Oculator and the first Talented human. He had the Dark Talent for breaking things.

He eventually broke the language of Incarna, sealing away the knowledge of Talents. He was entombed in a sphere of broken time. The Library of Alexandria was re-located around the tomb. He was also the owner of a pair of Truthfinder's Lenses.

In The Scrivener's Bones, the protagonist Alcatraz finds the tomb in the older section of the library when he felt a powerful charge from an activated lens. He broke a wall in order to reach the charge, carefully displacing a bookshelf. He entered the room to find the incarnate wheel on the wall. There was also text, presumably from Allekatrase, that called the breaking talent the Bane of Incarna, the Dark Talent. Alcatraz then entered the area of broken time used to embalm Allekatrase. On his sarcophagus was a Truthfinder's lens that could only be taken out using the breaking talent. Underneath it was a small inscription that Alcatraz broke after reading.</description>

- Dalinar's description of Sadeas's betrayal

The Battle of the Tower is a major engagement during the War of Reckoning fought by the combined armies of the Alethi Highprinces Dalinar Kholin and Torol Sadeas against the Parshendi forces led by Eshonai. The engagement takes place on a plateau of the Shattered Plains called the Tower, the largest and most coveted of the plateaus.

The battle is actually a trap engineered by Sadeas to murder Dalinar, leading to a massive loss of life, resulting in a strategic and tactical defeat for the Alethi side. In particular, Dalinar's army is severely weakened while Sadeas's army is practically untouched.</description>

      <description>The Atad Mountains, known to the Fjordell as the Dathreki Mountains, comprise a mountain range on the continent of Opelon on Sel.

The mountains lie along the border of Arelon and Fjorden. For many years, the Derethi were unable to invade Arelon due to the natural barrier afforded by the mountains, contributing to their hatred of the Arelene.

The range is considered a major geographical feature of Arelon; the curvature of the mountains is mirrored in the right side of Aon Aon, the basic symbol of AonDor.

Devotion's Perpendicularity is located in the northern end of the mountains, near Elantris and Kae.</description>

Akinah is the ancient capital of the Silver Kingdom of Aimia on Roshar. In more modern times, it is also known as The Rock of Secrets and The Void's Playground. The city itself was destroyed long ago, and during the Era of Solitude it exists only as a ruin. It is the location of an apparently functional Oathgate and its underwater caverns formerly contained a Dawnshard.</description>

      <description>The Aredel River flowed through Arelon. It began at Lake Alonoe, ran beneath Elantris, and formed a bay near Kae when it joined with the Sea of Fjorden. Occasionally it was diverted to rinse out the sewers of Kae, because their plumbing ceased to function after the Reod

The Aredel River appeared on Aon Eno, the character for water.

Raoden and Karata accessed it via a well inside Elantris, and allowed the current to carry them out of the city.</description>

      <description>"There was no subtlety to what the Bloodsealer did; they didn’t traffic in subtlety. Instead of skill or artistry, they used tricks and blood. However, their craft was effective."

- Wan ShaiLu on Bloodsealing

Bloodsealing is a manifestation of Investiture practiced by the Bloodsealers of Dzhamar on the planet Sel. Much like the better known Forgery, Bloodsealing makes use of stamps to create Bloodseals, runes powered by the Investiture of the Dor which can create a range of magical effects. However, that is where the similarities end. Instead of the conventional organic inks of Forgery, Bloodsealers make use of human blood as the ink in their stamp.</description>

- Rysn discussing her babsk

Babsk (plural babsk) is a term for a teacher or master in Thaylenah. Legally, a babsk is father to their apprentices as long as the apprenticeship lasts. Their apprentices follow them around, assisting them with their trade, and learning from them. Vstim, Rysn's babsk, is kind to her and wants to teach her how to be a good merchant, but not all babsk are, and this may not be common behavior. Rysn's full name appears to be Rysn Ftori bah-Vstim; it is unclear whether this is a personal sign of respect or if all Thaylen apprentice merchants append their babsk's name.</description>

      <description>Chedesh is a nation on ancient Nalthis, which has a large empire. The people of Chedesh are described as dominating the world in that age. However, their writings are sparse, and they have long faded away in the present day, though Hoid says their memory remains.

The Chedesh people are credited with discovering the tropical, jungle region that would later be Hallandren, along with the Tears of Edgli, though the Pahn Kahl are originally native to the region. Vo was on a Chedesh ship, and Returned along the coast of Hallandren. The people of that ship found a kingdom, which they name Hanald, on the beach that T'Telir is located. Hanald is eventually renamed to Hallandren, its modern name.

The people of Chedesh travel the Bright Sea from the east, opposite from Hallandren, which is a similar description as to where Tedradel is from, so Tedradel could be where Chedesh was originally.</description>

      <description>Biblioden is the man who founded the Librarians with his teachings.

He believed that the real world was too strange and dangerous to be known about by the majority of people, and so it must be hidden from them. This lead to the mass censorship and alteration of history which the Librarians have accomplished in the present day. Not all the Librarians are in agreement on how his teachings should be followed, however. Most Librarians have no qualms about using Free Kingdomer technology -- they just believe it should be kept from the average person. The Order of the Shattered Lens take his teachings more literally and believe that all glass-based technology is blasphemy and should be destroyed on sight.

He was thought to be dead until rumors of the return of the Scrivener are heard. Instead of death, however, it turns out that he had merely put himself to sleep until the finalization of his plan for world unity was near.

He has been posing as Dif, a Smedry cousin, for years, waiting for a chance to destroy the Smedry family from within.</description>

The Aonic people migrated to the region surrounding Elantris several thousand years before the Reod occurred. Aonic people are more lighter skinned than people from JinDo, with people from Duladel in between, since they're a mix of Aonic and JinDo. Most people in Arelon and Teod are of Aonic descent. They look similar for the most part, although the Teos tend to be taller than people from Arelon, and Sarene (who was from Teod) had light hair, as opposed the average brown hair in Arelon.</description>

      <description>Bornwater was the largest mining town in Bavland on Roshar.

Because of its location in Jah Keved, Bornwater is a town of Vorin descent, though it is much more lax in its social decorum, with women often leaving their safehand exposed as a provocative and flirty act.

Bornwater, while under the purview of its local landlord who resides in Kneespike, is most likely largely ignored by Jah Keved similar to most places in Bavland.

Protection from highstorms is provided for the town in that the whole of it was built in a lait, the large cliffside to the east. However, it seems that the architecture still follows cultural tendencies, with long flat roofs that slope gently to the east, even though being in a lait renders this unnecessary.</description>

      <description>"That's it, in the Western Dominance, as you guessed. Somewhere near Chardees?"

- Vin discussing the location of the last of the Lord Ruler's storage caches with Elend.

Chardees was a city in the Western Dominance of the Final Empire on Scadrial. It was near Fadrex City.

When Vin and Elend Venture were in Vetitan's storage cache, they found a metal map of the Final Empire that labeled the location every storage cache. The fifth and final one was in the Western Dominance, and Vin initially thought the map indicated the cache was near Chardees, before Elend noted it was actually at Fadrex City.

Vin thinks to herself that she was worse at geography than Elend, so the fact that she thought of Chardees instead of Fadrex may imply that Chardees was once a city of importance in the Western Dominance, before Cett made Fadrex the Dominance's capital city.</description>

      <description>"I am the Lady Valette Renoux, fourth cousin to Lord Teven Renoux, who owns this mansion. My parents--Lord Hadren and Lady Fellette Renoux--live in Chakath, a city in the Western Dominance. Major export, wool."

- Vin about her false identity as Valette.

Chakath is a city in the Western Dominance of the Final Empire on Scadrial. Its major export is wool.

He was a victim of the Scribbler. His father, Didrich Calloway was the knight-senator of East Carolina. He was taken right under his father's nose, with guards all around. As the chalklings surrounded him and he realized he wasn't going to make it, he drew a picture of his attacker and wrote a description. He didn't give up hope, however, and fought till the very end. He managed a Shoaff defense, a difficult nine pointer. He was a top Rithmatist. They did eventually recover him and return him to his family.</description>

      <description>Ars Arcanum is a glossary or appendix section at the end of the books that are part of the cosmere universe. The information is presented from an in-universe perspective.

Every Ars Arcanum is written by Khriss. The annotations on many of the images from the various books are made by her assistant Nazh.

Brandon initially planned to use the phrase "Ars Magica" for these glossaries, as he felt it was "a cool Latinate take on 'Magical Arts' or 'Magical Skills'." However, there was a role-playing game with that name, so he instead went with "Ars Arcanum," which he ultimately felt had more of a true-Latinate feel.</description>

Using far inferior ships, he managed to convince the enemy he intended to surrender and join them when first approaching, then suddenly turned on them. He did this by invoking a rarely used article of the law that let him take over the ship he was on. This battle was later used multiple times as a simulation for Dennison Crestmar to fight.</description>

Many biographies and histories spoke of her, but neglected to mention the fact that Varion looked upon her with a great deal of fondness.

During a final battle between imperial forces and Varion near the planet Falna, Dennison Crestmar ordered an attack on Charisa's squadron, saying that nothing was important as destroying those fighters, which would be a big blow to Varion personally. The fighters were destroyed, and Charisa as well.</description>

Barlesha Lhan is the author of Topics on Roshar.

Lin Davar owned a full set of his books, which Shallan learned from. When she mentioned to Jasnah Kholin that she had studied them, Jasnah dismissed them, saying that they were not worth the time it took to write them.</description>

Aslydin fled her home when it was attacked by the Inquisitors, and traveled with the other Terris refugees to the Pits of Hathsin, where they established a camp. During the Battle of Hathsin Aslydin tended the wounded, and provided refreshments.

Aslydin falls in love with Demoux because of his honor, as well as the respect he earns from helping the Terris people during their time as refugees. Elend notices her gazing fondly at Demoux when she brings the Emperor tea.

Aslydin was created out of a promise Brandon made to his friend, Micah DeMoux, that the character named after him would find romance.</description>

      <description>BasMardin is a city on Scadrial where House Hasting was settled.

House Hasting fled there after the death of the Lord Ruler, but the house's heir, Telden Hasting, didn't stay in BasMardin because he feared for his safety because of koloss activities in that area and hence moved to Fadrex City.</description>

Abraham Desjardins is a member of the Reckoners.

Abraham is Canadian and has a slight French accent. He is usually a soft spoken person, which is contrasted by the fact that he apparently has a fondness for large guns. He is one of the Faithful. Prior to the arrival of Calamity, he was an officer in Candaian special forces; his entire squad was killed by the Epic Powder while he was in the stockade awaiting his court martial.</description>

      <description>Lord Cabe was a nobleman on Scadrial during the Final Empire.

He hosted a ball that Valette Renoux missed. Kliss suspected that Valette did not attend because of a relapse of her "malady", and seemed disappointed when Valette told her that she had simply been busy with her uncle. Since Cabe hosted a ball attended by Kliss and other nobles, he presumably belonged to one of the Great Houses, but it was likely one of the less-influential houses since Valette did not attend.</description>

      <description>Charrs Entrone was a noble on Scadrial during the Final Empire.

He was infamous for his twisted sense of pleasure, enjoying things like skaa bloodfights. However, one night after a skaa fight, Kelsier murdered the drunk Charrs Entrone, and dumped the lord's corpse in Keep Tekiel's gardens. As House Entrone was a major political ally of House Tekiel, Kelsier hoped that Charrs's death would lead Tekiel to suspect their rival, House Izenry, but Charrs's gambling opponent had been Crews Geffenry, who was a known Mistborn. Either Tekiel could blame Izenry, or House Geffenry--which had been petitioning for a stronger alliance with Tekiel. Kelsier did not care who was truly to blame, as he simply wanted the nobility to question and worry.

Later, Kliss suggested that Geffenry murdered Charrs Entrone as to make the Tekiels worry, and make them want additional allies. Rene, Kliss's date at that particular ball, thought this was unlikely. Still, Charrs' death lead to the killings of Ardous and Callins Geffenry at Tekiel's hands.</description>

Braches was a man who lived during the classical era of Scadrial.

Braches knew Alendi, the presumed Hero of Ages, and told him tales of islands in the south of Scadrial that have volcanoes. He was known for his inquisitive nature, and once promised Alendi that he would investigate the Feruchemical powers of Rashek and the rest of the Terris packmen who accompanied Alendi to the Well of Ascension.

Rashek and the packmen likely killed him when they killed Alendi.</description>

      <description>Lord Augustin Tekiel is a prominent member of House Tekiel on Scadrial.

Augustin Tekiel began a smuggling operation in order to avoid taxes on aluminum. He claimed aluminum was other goods, such as wool, with the help of railway workers. This scam was successful and profitable for around two years. However, Miles Dagouter and his crew of thieves, the Vanishers, somehow discovered Tekiel's fraud, possibly on the advice of the Set. Miles and his Vanishers robbed a train carrying one of these fraudulent shipments in order to get enough aluminum for their weapons and to finance themselves.

Augustin Tekiel feared that if he drew too much attention to the theft, his criminal activity would be discovered. As a result, he waited three months before he began to make a commotion about the robbery. He wrote a public letter slamming the city constables as incompetent because they had failed to stop the crime or recover his goods. The letter was printed in several broadsheets, likely including the Elendel Daily.

Lord Waxillium Ladrian uncovered this crime via logical deduction while studying the Vanisher robberies.</description>

- Bahmen to Cett

Bahmen was an aide to Ashweather Cett during the Siege and Battle of Luthadel.

When Vin attacked Straff Venture's army with koloss, killing Straff in the process, Bahmen had advised that Cett could add his forces to either side, leading a decisive victory, instead of Cett's original plan, which was to wait for Vin and Straff's forces to destroy each other. That way, Cett could seize Luthadel for himself. In the end, both because of Bahmen and because Allrianne Cett rode to help Vin's forces, Cett came to assist Luthadel.</description>

      <description>Bennitson is the author of Armies in Motion, a book about military tactics on Scadrial during the Final Empire.

While touting his own knowledge of military tactics to Elend Venture, Aradan Yomen used the phrase "distinct points". Elend immediately recognized this terminology from Bennitson's work, and ascertained that Yomen's knowledge of war was scholarly, rather than practical.

"One thing that we scholars tend to forget about, Yomen, is the impact emotion can have on a battle. It isn't just about food, shoes, and clean water, necessary as those are. It's about hope, courage, and the will to live. Soldiers need to know that their leader will be in the fight -- if not killing enemies, then directing things personally from behind the lines. They can't think of him as an abstract force up on a tower somewhere, watching out a window and pondering the depths of the universe."

He did this reservedly, and Sazed noted how his signature on the treaty was incredibly cramped, as he knew he had been beaten and had no choice but to join Elend's empire or die, regardless of his own problems with the agreement.

He presumably fights in the Battle of the Tower with the rest of Bridge Four, although he is not mentioned by name. He is then freed from service under Sadeas when Highprince Dalinar Kholin trades his Shardblade, Oathbringer, for the freedom of the bridgemen.

Despite the fact that he has never been a slave, Beld receives the Bridge Four freedom tattoo on his forehead, composed of the glyph for freedom, as well as the date of their freedom and the words "Bridge Four".

Beld also serves as a member of the King's Guard, protecting King Elhokar. During Szeth's first attempt on Dalinar's life at the Pinnacle, Captain Kaladin sends Beld and Hobber ahead of the main group as an advanced guard. Beld is run through by Szeth's Honorblade and is killed instantly.

Kaladin remembers him, Jaks, Malop, Pedin, Rod, Mart, Goshel, Nalma, Dallet and the squad, and Tien while trying to say the Fourth Ideal of the Windrunners.</description>

In 1173, Abrial attended one of King Hanavanar's feasts in Vedenar. During the feast, Szeth attempted to assassinate the king on Taravangian's orders.

Alai claimes that spren were fragments of the powers of creation, which is a common opinion among scholars. She also studies spren that have gained sentience, such as the Nightwatcher. Alai claims that the Nightwatcher is one of these, and that it is definitely female, contrary to Alethi folktales.

      <description>The Breaknaught is an armored train car on Scadrial.

It was built by House Tekiel as a desperate response to the Vanishers previous raids which has affected their stock prices. It was advertised as being completely impenetrable to regain the faiths of the investors. Not only the safe is welded onto the car, but there was a timed locking mechanism on it that wouldn't open for twelve hours after being closed.

Prior to its maiden excursion, the carriage is on public display. Wayne staged a distraction to allow Wax to board, while preventing the eight guards who were supposed to board from getting on. Wax then put up bomb on the door and net trap in the car for capturing Miles. The Vanishers swapped the entire cargo compartment with a replica provided by the Set, with Wax still inside. This goes exactly as Wax's plan, because they then take it and him back to their base. Miles has also correctly guessed the presence of Wax inside the car. After the Breaknaught's door is yanked off in Vanisher's workshop, the fight begins.</description>

The Askarki are a group of humans on Roshar. The Emuli are said to be a "tribe" of the Askarki, but the Emuli are also ethnically Makabaki. This could suggest that the Askarki are not an ethnicity. The origin of the Askarki people are unknown. It is unclear if they are an ancient group who have carried through to modern day, a purely modern group, or an ancient group who have faded from existence. It is unclear what the Askarki people's relationship has been with Makabakam and its people historically.</description>

      <description>"Within a heartbeat, Alezarv was there, crossing a distance that would have taken more than four months to travel by foot."

- Another folktale, this one recorded in Among the Darkeyed, by Calinam. Page 102. Stories of instantaneous travel and the Oathgates pervade these tales.

Alezarv was a person existing in the time prior to the Recreance on Roshar. They may have been a member of the Knights Radiant.

At some point, Alezarv used an Oathgate. This was recorded in the text Among the Darkeyed (suggesting perhaps Alezarv was darkeyed) by Calinam and Jasnah Kholin included it in her notebook.</description>

 * For the sphere he considered "most important" and gave to Szeth, see Anti-Voidlight
 * For the sphere he gave to Eshonai, see Voidlight or Lights

A Bav worker named Took claimed to have stolen a similar dark sphere from the Nightwatcher. Took was known to exaggerate, and his story may be apocryphal.</description>

- Vathi

Aviar are birds that have gained magical powers, or "talents", on the island of Patji on First of the Sun. They are capable of sharing their powers with humans. Aviar were long thought to be exclusively native to the Pantheon archipelago, but other birds can become Aviar if they visit the island and ingest the fruit of Patji's Fingers.</description>

Bloodscratches are small enough to fit inside a cup or bowl. It is unknown if they are common only on Patji or if they are also present on the other islands of the Pantheon.

Like most native lifeforms on Patji, bloodscratches are dangerous to humans. Every time Sixth of the Dusk returns to one of his safecamps, he checks blankets and dishware in the room for bloodscratches and other small and deadly creatures.</description>

      <description>Arts and Majesty is an ancient work of Rosharan literature that has come to define the Vorin ideas of masculine and feminine arts. It defines certain topics and practices as feminine or masculine; the feminine arts are generally those that can be practiced with a single hand, while the masculine arts involve both hands, associating delicacy with women and brute force with men. The idea of the safehand comes from this distinction between one-handed and two-handed arts.</description>

      <description>Camon's safe house is Camon's crew's base of operations.

The safe house is in a skaa slum known as the Twists, close to the Iron Gate in Luthadel. It consists of two main sections: a shop, located at ground level, that serves as a front for the crew's operations, and a stone cavern underneath the building, where the crew lives and plans their jobs. It has several watch-holes from which crewmembers can watch the streets for any signs of danger. Vin frequently spent her free time in the watch-holes, as she could be alone there, which made her feel relatively safe.

After Vin was caught Soothing a Canton of Finance obligator to help Camon scam them, two Steel Ministry spies and a Steel Inquisitor followed them back to the safe house; the spies were killed by Dockson before they could report back and Kelsier distracted the Inquisitor. In returns for this service, Kelsier demanded the use of the safe house that evening, as he wanted a neutral place to hold an initial meeting to discuss his plan to overthrow the Final Empire with his crew. As punishment for Camon's treatment of Vin, Kelsier replaced him as crewleader with Milev and ordered the crew to let Camon live, but to make sure his life was unpleasant. After meeting with his crew, just as the mists started to come out, Kelsier left to steal some atium while Vin and Dockson headed for Clubs' shop, leaving the safe house for the crew.

Around the time Vin trains in emotional Allomancy with Breeze, Steel Inquisitors, looking for Vin, tracked down the safe house and slaughtered the entire crew. After that, the building was abandoned.

After Vin and Zane's attack on Cett's army, OreSeur found Vin hiding in one of the old watch-holes, and reported her location to Elend Venture. Elend then went to comfort her and convinced her to come out.</description>

He is a short, slender, balding French man. He manifested after Stephen recovered Balubal Razon's camera. He is a physicist specializing in temporal mechanics, causality, and quantum theories.

J.C. seems to like him, though the friendliness is not really reciprocated. This may be because, after Arnaud makes a speculation about the nature of the aspects and how they can remember having past lives, he takes it to mean he is an Interdimensional Time Ranger.

After Stephen recovered the camera he set Arnaud to the task of seeing how it worked and replicating it. He was able to make the camera go back in time about 6 months. After fixing the camera he wished to return home to his family in France and not be a aspect any longer. He helped Stephen escape from the virtual reality prison.</description>

She was married to Dean Knighthawk. After her Epic powers manifested, she joined a team of would-be superheroes along with Jonathan Phaedrus, Abigail Reed, and Lincoln. She eventually succumbed to Calamity's corruption and was subsequently killed by Phaedrus. Her husband kept her body in stasis and repeatedly attempted to revive her using various Epic-derived healing technology, but he was unsuccessful. Some time after Calamity was defeated, she was finally revived, possibly by Phaedrus' healing power, though the complete story is somewhat complicated.

It is unknown what powers Amala had or what her weakness was.</description>

- Kairominas

Aurorastones are magical stones found in Alornia that are used to power various mechanisms. The stones are capable of being charged via Lancing, and are used to maintain Lancing feats without Kairominas needing to be around. It is implied that the power of an Aurorastone diminishes over time, and that Kai must then recharge them with Lancing.

The known uses for Aurorastone include weather control, automated carriages resembling cars within Alornia cities, and enchanted swords.</description>

He drove Coach 16 on the night of Lady ZoBell's party and was hired by someone who gave their name as Shanwan - a Terris name meaning "secret". He was traumatized by seeing Bleeder and ended up at a Soothing parlor on Decan Street trying in vain to forget.

"I found I hadn't been carrying a man, but a monster. A mistwraith, with bones and sinew exposed, and a face of stretched muscle and grinning teeth. It looked at me, all smiles, and scrambled up toward the hole. It pressed that exposed eye against the slot, and then it changed. It changed. Skin growing over its face, like mine. A twisted, broken version of me."

"He eventually reached the location he’d set out to find: Ashweather Carriage and Coach, a large open yard at the northern edge of the octant where a fleet of carriages of various styles was stored. Rich-looking landaus with retractable tops. Conventional buggies, with less lavish upholstery and wood, to attract a modest clientele. A few surrey-style, with frilled tops. By far the most common in the carriage park was the standard road coach: the four-wheeled vehicle with a completely enclosed passenger compartment, and room at the top front for a driver. They called them Barringtons in the city, after Lord Barrington, and though the paint jobs could vary wildly, the style was pretty much standardized. Wax's own coaches were Barringtons."

The Bands of Mourning are the legendary Feruchemical bracers that were supposedly created by the Lord Ruler and could purportedly grant the wearer his powers. However, while they did grant all known Allomantic and Feruchemical abilities, they were not actually made by the Lord Ruler, and instead, the Sovereign was involved. "Bands of Mourning" is a misleading name to prevent people from finding it.</description>

      <description>The Allomantic Agreement of '94 is a law regulating the use of Allomancy. It was passed before the time of Shadows of Self, which is in the year 342 (after the Final Ascension), so it must have been enacted in year 194 or 294 (the apostrophe in the title implies that it was not in year 94).

One of its provisions is the prohibition of using Rioters for commercial gain, i.e. to influence customers into buying by manipulating their emotions. However, there is no law against paying Allomancers for their services, e.g. Coinshots as couriers or Soothing parlors.

Significant government resources are used to enforce this law, with entire departments watching for violations of it.</description>

      <description>Aluminum is the internal enhancement pulling metal. An Allomancer burning aluminum will make all of their metal reserves vanish. Feruchemists can use aluminum to store Identity, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, aluminum removes all powers. It is known as Ralkalest or the unForgeable metal in the Rose Empire on Sel as well as among singers.

Aluminum metal (and some of its alloys) are "Allomantically inert" -- they cannot be Pushed or Pulled, and can shield people from emotional Allomancy. Aluminum generates no atium shadows and can create dead zones within cadmium and bendalloy bubbles, where the shielded area is not included within the time bubble. It also interferes with Feruchemical healing, by making it impossible for wounds to heal around the aluminum until it is removed from the body. There is a similar effect on pewter Allomancy.

Aluminum has been confirmed to have strange effects to all magic systems, is magically inert, and will act as an Investiture sink.</description>

      <description>Carla is the leader of the Stingray Clan. She is an stocky, older Ildithian woman with thinning hair.

When Tia came to Ildithia, Carla allowed her to hide among them. While the others in the Stingray Clan protested, Carla claimed that protecting Tia was something they needed to do. However, Prof ended up tracking Tia to them, due to finding her cola in a shipment for the Stingray Clan. Carla started preparing for a fight before Tia decided to give herself up to protect them. Carla agreed, and though she was sorry for giving Tia up, she needed to protect the Stingray Clan. Carla and the other members of the Stingray Clan pretended to not know who Tia was, and they were spared.</description>

Alloran Feltri is a politician in Elendel on Scadrial.

He was a candidate for the Canalworkers 2nd Seat in the elections for the Elendel legislature in the fall of 341, and was considered the prohibitive favorite. However, The Elendel Daily ran an article alleging that he was an Allomancer and that he may have used his abilities to influence his constituents, which would have been a major scandal. The broadsheet's source was a former mistress of Feltri's who claimed that he was a Rioter.</description>

As of the True Desolation, Abaray accompanied Odium's army in its invasion of Thaylen City and participated in the Battle of Thaylen Field.

      <description>"Yes, we let darkeyes in. But not runts."

- Blackcaps to Skar

The Blackcaps are the personal guard of Highprince Aladar on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

The Blackcaps wear a black uniform and helm when they are on duty. They are an elite force, and while they allow darkeyes to join, they are still very selective with their membership.

Skar tried to join the Blackcaps when he came to the Shattered Plains. Due to Skar's stature, the Blackcaps turned him down, although they claimed they would reconsider if Skar managed to find himself some weapons and armor. Skar stole the required equipment from the Blackcap quartermaster, believing that they would see his theft as a sign of his enthusiasm and cleverness. However, the Blackcaps instead branded Skar a slave and he was later sold to Highprince Torol Sadeas and made a bridgeman. It is likely that the Blackcaps accompanied Highprince Aladar on Dalinar Kholin's expedition to center of the Shattered Plains and participated in the Battle of Narak. After the start of the True Desolation, the Blackcaps took turns with other groups of soldiers going on plateau runs to collect gemhearts from chasmfiends.</description>

After Urithiru was rediscovered, Chanada traveled there via the Oathgate along with the rest of the people from the warcamps. After she heard that Dalinar Kholin and Navani Kholin were courting, she had Kadash go to all the other ardents, such as Rushu and Ladent to order them not to perform a marriage ceremony between the two. As a result, Dalinar and Navani could not find an ardent to marry them, so the Stormfather had to officiate instead.</description>

- From Hessi's Mythica, page 224

Ashertmarn, the Heart of the Revel, is a mindless Unmade. He takes the form of a giant, black, inhuman heart that beats to an irregular rhythm. Thick black veins spout from the heart, melding with the ground nearby. He leads people to indulge in excess. He speaks to the people in his area, urging them to abandon their lives and responsibilities. The closer one is to him, the harder it is to resist Ashertmarn's tempting plea.</description>

- From Hessi's Mythica, page 203

Ba-Ado-Mishram, sometimes called just Mishram, is one of the Unmade, an ancient and terrible spren of Odium. She is a sapient Unmade and is crafty and conniving. She was a primary instigator of the False Desolation, leading to her imprisonment by the Knights Radiant, which put the vast majority of singers into slaveform, and affected all spren on Roshar.

She is unique among the Unmade for having two hyphens in her name, whereas others only have one or zero.</description>

The provenance of the name "Burning Gardens" is not known, but a map stolen from Smolderbrand by Nazh indicates that it is not simply a garden, as there are some large buildings located there.

In the Physical Realm, the location of the Burning Gardens corresponds to the northeastern portion of the Tarat Sea, near Mevan Bay.</description>

      <description>Candlemore is a lighthouse in the Sea of Lost Lights. It lies in the Sea of Oracles, and is near the Salavashi Trench.

On that Nazh stole, he writes that he rode from Celebrant to Candlemore on a mandra, and that someone (likely Khriss) owes him some silver pieces for a bet.

In the Physical Realm, it is likely very close to Kelathar, north of the Sunmaker Mountains.</description>

- Borea to Azure on her Blade

Borea is an honorspren who serves as the first mate of the ship Honor's Path.

Borea had some sort of encounter with Nightblood or had heard of his passage through Lasting Integrity. In 1174, Borea was on the Honor's Path when they took Sylphrena and her companions aboard. Azure spoke to Borea and explained to her that her weapon was a Shardblade that required no spren to be made. Azure told Borea that in exchange for the return of her weapon, information on Nightblood, and eventual passage to her destination, she would explain to Borea how her weapon had been crafted. Borea drew Azure's Blade herself and was investigated by her. Borea expressed shock that Azure had a Shardblade that required no enslavement and agreed to the deal.

Like Notum, Borea wears a stiff and no nonsense uniform.</description>

- The Fused who possesses Altoki

Altoki is a listener who becomes one of the Fused.

Ulim selected Venli, Demid, Melu, Mrun, Altoki and five others to open themselves to "new power" during the Everstorm. The group was not aware that they were volunteering their bodies as vessels for the Fused, which would effectively destroy their original identities. Odium prevented Venli from being chosen by a Fused, but all of the other singers were either possessed or killed. Altoki was possessed by an unnamed Fused that seemed predatory and deranged.</description>

      <description>Anthony Davis, known simply as Davis, is a police officer in New Clipperton who focuses on investigating crimes by using Snapshots. He has been working in the Snapshots with his partner, Chaz, for a few years but before working in the Snapshot Division he worked on the normal police force for ten years. During a shootout Davis had a guy in his sights but wasn't able to pull the trigger and later Perez, a fellow police officer, was shot and killed by the man who Davis could have killed. As a result, Davis began to have extreme anxiety and was recommended for Snapshot duty.

Davis has been divorced for six months from his ex-wife, Molly. Although the divorce means that Davis isn't allowed to see his son, Hal, Davis visits his son as much as he can in the Snapshot. Davis insists on being the one to turn off the Snapshot because he knows turning off the Snapshot kills the Hal who is in the Snapshot.

After dealing with The Photographer, Davis attempts to kill Chaz, who has been secretly sleeping with Molly while Davis visits Hal. Davis points his gun at Chaz and explains his motives but after thinking about his ex-wife, son, and his own future, Davis decides not to go through with it. It is later revealed that the IRL Davis did shoot and kill Chaz and the Snapshot Davis doesn't shoot because of a Deviation.</description>

A performance at Clarvonne's Theater in Elendel was advertised in The House Record on the 1st of Doxil, 342. The title is a play on the term "Hero of Ages", and the operetta presumably tells the story of Vin and Elend during the Final Empire. The advertisement appears to depict the couple reaching toward each other while wearing mistcloaks. Vin is held back by a group of Steel Inquisitors and Elend by a group of skaa.</description>

      <description>Barb is Wilson's grandniece and Stephen Leeds' new butler.

Barb is a young woman with short blonde hair. Stephen thinks she looks awkward wearing coachman's gear. Barb is a upbeat person who truly wishes to be of help to Stephen, but Stephen repeatedly rejects her help.

Barb is a competent butler and chauffeur, but is new to Stephen and his aspects, so isn't the best at working around them as Wilson does. She is able to make lemonade using Wilson's recipe.

She shadowed Wilson buttling for some time before he left Stephen on his seventieth birthday. As Stephen's new butler, she drove him to the fairground and operated Razon's camera for him. She drove him to WODE and attempted to help him infiltrate, but Stephen rebuffed her offers of help. She returned after Stephen finished his infiltration to pick him up and drive him to Wilson's birthday party.</description>

      <description>In the cosmere, axon (plural axi) is a word that either means an atom (in the scientific sense) or the more ambiguous concept of the smallest division of matter. The latter definition might apply to subatomic particles or other types of entities, depending on the theoretical model espoused by the one using the word.</description>

      <description>Arturo Mendez (callsign Amphisbaena) is a member of the DDF and pilot number five in Skyward Flight. Both of his parents are pilots and he is the son of Valda Mendez. He is flight assistant to Jorgen during flight school, however, it is unknown if he retains this position after gaining full pilot status. He is in a relationship with Bryn, a friend he went to school with prior to joining the DDF.

His callsign, Amphisbaena, comes from the mythological two headed, ant-eating serpent that goes by the same name. His flightmates and other DDF staff have difficulty pronouncing his callsign, leading to it being shortened to Amphi. Cobb appears to be the only person who can pronounce Arturo's callsign, however all calls him by the shortened nickname.

His family is rich and owns three private starfighters that are used as escorts during trading operations. These ships are not accessible to the DDF during times of need as they are primarily reserved to evacuate the Mendez family if they are in danger. His family has a private radio frequency, 1250, as well as a private radio that is able to unscramble pilot frequencies.</description>

- Algernon criticizing Ironsides after a DDF battle

Algernon Weight is a National Assembly Leader (NAL) and the highforeman of Detritus’ largest intercavern shipping company. He is married to Jeshua Weight, a First Citizen, and is Jorgen’s father. The family lives in the lower caverns of Igneous.

Algernon is either currently, or has previously been, considered part of Detritus' military. He knows some amount about military tactics, including Lanchester’s Law. Algernon is an extremely influential member of the community and has achieved high merit for his accomplishments. As such he has access to high class and luxury technology, such as private fighter jets, of which the family owns three.

Algernon is a strong supporter of Dr. Thior's claim that the defect does not exist and believes claims of its existence to be foolish. Ironsides finds his immovability on the issue frustrating, believing his threshold for proof to be too high.</description>

- Cads to Vivenna

Cads is a man living on the streets of T'Telir in Hallandren. He is an extremely dirty man, but wears fancy clothing, though worn and dirty. He thinks it was funny and a mockery of highborn.

Cads seems to control an alley in T'Telir at the back of two restaurants, which contained garbage from the restaurants. He lets urchins and others access to the garbage for money, which he pays to the restaurant owners.

Cads let Vivenna eat from the garbage for one coin--one bit--which allowed Vivenna to eat until she was full. Another day, Vivenna came to Cads with a single bit, and Cads barred her entry. Vivenna pleaded that Cads knew she was bad at begging, but Cads responded that even kids can bring him two bits. Cads shooed Vivenna away, even though she had not eaten in days, and demanded that she bring two bits the next day.</description>

      <description>Bountiful Cavern is a cavern on Detritus, near Igneous. The cavern was initially settled and populated by the crew of the Antioch gunship. Despite its name, Bountiful Cavern is not responsible for food production.

Kimmalyn's family lives in Bountiful Cavern and are descended from the original Antioch crew. At least a portion of the caverns inhabitants are trained as gunners for the DDF, including Kimmalyn and her parents. It is implied that the DDF keeps some sort of watch over the pool of gunners in Bountiful Cavern, as skill with the anti-airship (AA) guns can be transfer to a cockpit, making this cavern a good potential source for new pilots. Kimmalyn's recruitment to the pilot program was highly talked about amongst the gunners of Bountiful Cavern, even after she dropped out from Flight School.

Although those raised in Bountiful Cavern appear polite and mild mannered, they are good at subtle insults and jabs. People from Bountiful Cavern have an accent distinct from the people of Igneous. Kimmalyn often uses the phrase 'bless your stars' which may be used regularly by people this cavern. Kimmalyn's propensity to talk of the Saint may also be common within the cavern.</description>

      <description>The Battle of Trajerto is a skirmish between the DDF and Krell on Detritus.

Five years prior to Spensa joining Flight School, a Krell flight infiltrated DDF airspace and destroyed the smaller anti-air defences. Two DDF scouts successfully destroyed the lifebuster before it reached Alta, however the DDF came close to losing the base.

During Spensa's Flight School training, Arturo recognizes that Cobb used a modified recording of the battle as a simulation. Cobb mentions that he wouldn't have time simulating completely fresh scenarios, hinting that other historical battle recordings are used in the simulator.</description>

Only a few of the squad returned to Alta Base, and several of the ships were heavily damaged.</description>

The C-137-KJM orbital shipyard is an old steel ship found in the ring of debris surrounding Detritus. It orbited the planet for several centuries before falling to the surface when the acclivity rings that held it afloat ran out of power.</description>

      <description>Calligraphers Guild is an organization on Roshar responsible for creating glyphs.

The Guild maintains a list of official, canonical glyphs. Whenever a new glyph is required, they create it based on a number of rules that have arisen over time, although there is a lot of stylization permitted. Occasionally, they may also canonize a glyph created by an amateur, if it becomes popular enough. Over time, the Guild modifies some glyphs to make them seem more modern and match the contemporary styles.

The calligraphers can be rather secretive, but there aren't many mysteries to them. Their darkest secret is that glyphs can sometimes be read phonetically, although with older glyphs, the changes brought about by time can make the individual phonemes unreadable. The guild members, as well as scholars interested in how glyphs morph over time, are still able to recognize the phonemes making up even a heavily-altered glyph.

The Guild occasionally marks some scrolls with its symbol. What this means is uncertain; perhaps it indicates that the stamped scroll is a property of the Guild, or that it's confirmed to be using only canonical glyphs.</description>

      <description>Underfen Berbrath is a female sand master on Taldain. Her rank indicates that she is weak in sand mastery, and she appears to have been a cook for the Diem.

She was an older woman with gray hair, and she was seen wearing an apron over her robes. She approached Lord Mastrell Kenton asking when the next shipment of zaidon would arrive. She was one of several people who interrupted Kenton with relatively mundane questions, which led Khriss to suggest that he delegate some of his duties to Elorin and Dirin.</description>

      <description>Cambri is the supposed homeworld of the taynix. Due to Superiority propaganda regarding this species, it is unclear if this is true.

According to the Superiority, the taynix escaped Cambri on early trading vessels, and are considered an invasive species on many planets. However, it is possible the taynix cytonically teleported to other locations, and this story is a cover for that fact.

The cambric--one of the five species that head the government in the Superiority--may be from Cambri, due to the similarities in their names.</description>

Given the similarities in their names, they may come from the planet Cambri, the homeworld of the taynix. If so, that might explain how they developed faster-than-light travel and rose to the top of the Superiority.</description>

- Mrs. Chamwit

Akokian pudding is a type of food that can be found on Starsight.

It's both sweet and savory, and additionally possesses high nutritional value; despite the name suggesting it to be a dessert, it's apparently a good dinner dish. The UrDail - and possibly humans - are capable of eating and digesting it without issues. As such, Mrs. Chamwit offers to make it for Spensa during her stay on the station, and later sends her a small pastry. While Spensa finds the pastry delicious, she never confirms whether it was the Akokian pudding. It's likewise unclear what the name "Akokian" derives from.</description>

      <description>"I did get several other Superiority races—like the burl, who are citizens but considered aggressive—to join this test."

- Cuna

The burl are an alien species within the Superiority.

They are larger than most other races and resemble gorillas, although it seems they walk upright as default. While a member of the Superiority, the burl are considered too aggressive to attain primary citizenship. Nonetheless, some of them can be found living on Starsight, and a few participate in the Delver Resistance Program. Like most so-called lesser species, they are wary of Superiority leaders, and are treated as disposable by them in turn.</description>

One would think that now, with a single, immortal governor, society would finally have an opportunity to find stability and enlightenment."

- Excerpt from the Book of the False Dawn

The Book of the False Dawn is a subversive text during the Final Empire era written by Deluse Couvre. It is among those books Elend Venture leaves at the table at the first party Vin attends as Valette Renoux. It is disguised as a small black volume with the title Weather Patterns of the Northern Dominance with no title page or author.

Kelsier informs Vin that any Keeper can quote the entire thing, though most physical copies were thought destroyed. He marks it as "older" book which didn't outright encourage rebellion. The ministry never banned the book, hoping that its stuffiness would doom it to obscurity.</description>

ChanGaar is an imprisonment ritual used by the kandra on Scadrial to punish those who have committed the most serious of crimes.

The ritual consists of breaking the offending kandra's bones and then sealing them in a pit with only a small hole for food. The kandra is left there for ten generations, after which they are starved to death.

KanPaar sentences TenSoon to ChanGaar for rebelling against the council and betraying the secret of how to control the kandra to Vin. However, TenSoon uses his superior strength and speed that his canine body provides him to escape before it could be carried out.</description>

      <description>"Hello, Blue. How watery's the beer today?"

- Wayne to Blue

Blue is a guard at a pub in Elendel on Scadrial. It is unclear whether that is his actual name, or just a nickname Wayne uses for him.

While on duty, Blue is a straightforward man, though he seems to be at least somewhat willing to play along with Wayne's antics. He wears a cap and overalls as his guard uniform and carries a stick for clubbing rowdy customers.</description>

      <description>The Argien-Ohr Financial Circle is the largest and most prestigious committee of bankers in Elendel.

After Paalm broke a dam causing the flooding of Corbeau the Circle convened an emergency meeting to discuss sending aid to the ravaged region. They discussed whether or not their investment would be enough to stave off the economic disaster of the region's grain production being reduced by half for the year. Lord Chapmot Heviers told The House Record that while they had enough supplies in reserve to last four months, afterwards grain would start going to the highest bidder. He predicted that bakers would start producing whiskey instead of bread as there was a larger profit to be made that way.</description>

      <description>The Challenge of Stormhold is a historical event on Roshar.

The Veristitalians Jasnah Kholin and Jochi occasionally debate the details of the Challenge. The Herald Shalash was present at the event and later tells Jasnah that it occurred because King Iyalid was drunk, which Jasnah indicates settles the argument in favor of Jochi.</description>

      <description>Chanasha Hasareh is a merchant on Roshar. She found modest success hiring out her chull teams to caravans crossing the Shattered Plains after most of the Alethi relocated to Urithiru.

Chanasha is lighteyed, although she is of a low dahn. She is presumably of the Vorin faith, as she wears a safehand sleeve. She is not the smiling type, and seems to be known as a shrewd negotiator. She always carries a reed in her pocket and never lets a day go by without reconciling her accounts. Her name is derived from the herald Chanaranach.

She was bribed to hide in a secure location for a month while Shallan impersonated her as part of an attempt to infiltrate the Sons of Honor.</description>

Some time after this transformation, he met and fell in love with a woman from Arelon. When she died in spite of Elantrian aid, his hatred of Elantris congealed into something that drove him to the point of madness. After leading the assaults on both Kae and Teod, he was killed by Hrathen, who could not tolerate his genocidal tendencies.</description>

Before Raoden was taken by the Shaod and thrown into Elantris, Eondel supported his movements. When Sarene came to Kae, he supported her in her plan to overthrow King Iadon. He also helped her take supplies into Elantris for her Widow's Trial, and saved her from being killed by one of Shaor's men.

After Sarene's plans were foiled by Hrathen and Duke Telrii became king, Eondel led his men in retaking the throne. He personally slew Telrii, but died from previously gotten wounds.

Eondel had a personal army, which was accepted to be the most effective fighting force in Arelon.

He was killed by Telrii in a duel just before the Invasion of Arelon. He is buried in one of the graves dedicated to those who had fought for Arelon alongside Saolin, Karata and Roial.</description>

      <description>"You’ve stumbled into something far, far bigger than you, your politics, or your little planet ... Your questions are dangerous. Once you step behind the curtain and see the actors as the people they are, it becomes harder to pretend the play is real"

- Khriss to Kelsier

The cosmere is a fictional shared universe where several of Brandon Sanderson's books take place. As a result, books set in the cosmere share a single cosmology and underlying rules of magic, and some characters from one world will make appearances on other worlds. Despite the connections, Brandon has remained clear that one does not need any knowledge of the broader cosmere to read, understand, or enjoy books that take place in the cosmere.

Elements of the cosmere are slowly being added to the books, and will eventually come to the forefront in the Dragonsteel series and the final Mistborn trilogy.

Current series in the cosmere are the Elantris trilogy, Mistborn series, Warbreaker (and its eventual sequel), The Stormlight Archive, and White Sand. It does not include any books that reference Earth, as Earth is not in the cosmere. For a complete list of books in the cosmere, see the bibliography section below.

The shared "creation myth" of the cosmere revolves around Adonalsium, the power of creation, which was broken into sixteen pieces called Shards in an event known as the Shattering of Adonalsium. The Shards are effectively gods, and magic is derived from their power.</description>

- Elantris Prologue

The City of Elantris is a city in Arelon on the continent of Opelon on Sel. Prior to the Reod and following the Invasion of Arelon, it served as the capital of Arelon. It is surrounded by four Gate Cities in each of the cardinal directions, of which Kae is one. It is accounted as one of the most beautiful cities on Sel, particularly by sculptors, who heaped countless praises on the city's sculptures. Its name incorporates Aon Ela, which means "center".</description>

In Realmatic Theory, the Cognitive Realm is the realm between the Spiritual and the Physical. It is described as the world of the mind. As even non-living things can have a Cognitive aspect in the cosmere, the Cognitive Realm is also a place where the thoughts and feelings of non-living things can be known.

Some beings like Soulcasters and Shards can have their consciousness or even their whole body appear on the Cognitive Realm using their Invested ability. It is also possible to use Perpendicularities to move to and from the Cognitive Realm.</description>

      <description>Dragonsteel refers to an unpublished series set on Yolen that has been called the prequel to the Cosmere. It takes place first chronologically and will feature the Shattering, Hoid's backstory, and dragons. One reason Brandon has not prioritized this series, though, is that he doesn't want readers to feel that they have to read his other books in order to understand what is happening, and he probably won't publish Hoid's story until it becomes relevant.

He plans to rewrite and publish Dragonsteel at some point after the full arc of the Stormlight Archive has been completed.</description>

      <description>Dumadari is a city on Roshar at the border of Jah Keved and Alethkar.

In, shortly after the death of Gavilar Kholin, Dalinar plans to take an army via Dumadari and sail to New Natanan to set up a base on the Shattered Plains before the rest of the Alethi armies arrive. He uses the journey as a cover for visiting the Nightwatcher.

In, Princess Jasnah Kholin visited Dumadari, likely while doing research of some sort. When Brightness Shallan Davar wrote to Jasnah requesting to become her ward, Jasnah invited her to come to Dumadari in two weeks for consideration. Jasnah did not believe that Shallan would arrive in Dumadari before she herself had left, but she did not know where she would be traveling next. Shallan was shocked that Jasnah had responded, but she arrived in Dumadari after Jasnah's departure. However, Jasnah had left a note in Dumadari requesting that Shallan follow Jasnah to her next destination.

During a strategy meeting before the Battle of Thaylen Field, Fen reminds Dalinar that the enemy fleet is dangerous to leave unchallenged, for it can easily attack many ports, including Kharbranth or Dumadari.</description>

      <description>The Church of the Survivor (later Survivorism) is a religion on Scadrial founded during the fall of the Final Empire and the ascension of Harmony. Their symbol is a wooden spear painted silver.

The religion is based upon the exploits of Kelsier, the Survivor of Hathsin. Some of the "miracles" alleged by faithful members of the religion were actually trickery using Allomancy and later using a kandra. These "miracles" were part of Kelsier's master plan to upset the balance of power in the Final Empire. The religion was taken up mostly by skaa with prominent figures such as Demoux and also Elend, who joined the Church to further his position with the skaa. During the events in Urteau, the heavy influence of the Church led to the rise of the Survivor of Flames, Spook.

It eventually evolved into the modern Scadrian religion of Survivorism. Survivorism also calls Kelsier The Lord of the Mists, teaching that Kelsier will appear on misty nights and bless the independent. Followers of Survivorism are considered anyone who survives on their own, or thinks for themselves.

Additional figures in the religion include Vin, who was originally known as The Heir of the Survivor and is now known as The Ascendant Warrior, and Sazed (Harmony), named "Holy First Witness" by early members of the church. Another figure, The Lord Mistborn, is Spook, who was made a Mistborn by Sazed (Harmony) after the world was reborn and asked to look after humanity.

After Sazed ascended to become Harmony, he left a book detailing the events leading up to the rebirth of the world including the Hero of Ages prophecy. He also left books that contained all of the knowledge contained in his Copperminds. These become known as The Words of Founding.

The Pathians and Survivorists both use these books. Despite this, the Survivorists dislike those who follow the Path, but the feeling isn't reciprocated.

Survivorism followers around 340 include Father Bin, Steris, Marasi and Clamps. Miles was a follower until he converted to Trellism.</description>

      <description>Elendel is the largest city in the Elendel Basin on Scadrial and in the cosmere at large. Named by The Lord Mistborn, Spook, for Elend Venture, it is located at the mouth of the Irongate river where it flows into Hammondar Bay. Though no accurate estimate exists for population size, there are certainly millions of residents, and estimates top out at around five million.

Elendel is also the central power in the Basin and is home to many noble houses.</description>

- Words of Radiance chapter 38, page 6

The Day of Recreance was the final act of the Knights Radiant. Nine of the ten orders abandoned their Shardblades and Shardplate and broke their oaths, killing their spren. The Order of Skybreakers was the one order that did not participate; instead the Skybreakers hid themselves away. For around two thousand years the reason for the Recreance remained unknown until it was rediscovered in the Eila Stele during the True Desolation.</description>

      <description>Derethil was a western king on Roshar, who ruled during the Desolations He had fair skin and light eyes. He fought the Voidbringers alongside the Heralds and Knights Radiant.

After the Desolation, he commissioned the ship Wandersail and sailed westward, seeking the origin of the Voidbringers. He set off into a highstorm, and after sailing sometime through the storm, they found themselves crashed on an island in an archipelago surrounding a whirlpool. The island's people called themselves the Uvara, the People of the Great Abyss. They nursed the survivors from the Wandersail back to health. The Uvarans punished all failure of any type with execution at the command of their emperor. Derethil discovered that the Uvaran emperor was dead, which caused chaos and rioting among the Uvarans because they had to take responsibility for the brutal murders that they committed in his name. They escaped on the Wandersail with Nafti, the crew's guide and caretaker.

The story of his travels to the isles of Uvara was told by Hoid to Kaladin, possibly using Lightweaving

This story deals heavily with taking responsibility for one's actions, and has parallels to Szeth's turmoil, who was forced to go through an almost identical realization during the Battle of Narak. It also parallels Kaladin's choosing to blame various sources, such as lighteyes or the Almighty for his misfortune.</description>

Quellion rules in Urteau since Straff Venture left to besiege Luthadel. Spook, Sazed and Breeze try to reason with Quellion, but decide to take him down instead. They attempt to incite a revolution, but discover that they have been playing into the hands of Ruin, who has been subtly influencing both Spook and Quellion via Hemalurgic Spikes. A fire breaks out, threatening to destroy the town, but Spook removes the spikes and floods the Canals, saving the city.</description>

      <description>Dawncity is a term used to describe a city on Roshar that is old enough to be able to trace the origin of said city all the way back to the Dawnsingers.

As of 1173, discussing the Dawncities had recently become fashionable among the Alethi lighteyes. No city has yet been confirmed to be a Dawncity. One man, Au-nak seemed to believe that the city of Sesemalex Dar was a Dawncity, due to the complex stone patterns that the city was built within. Highprince Hatham's wife studied the Dawncities.

The Dawncities may have been created with the use of Surgebinding, but in Dalinar's visions, he has seen no sign of any of the Dawncities.

They are beyond the scope of what a group of Radiants could create.</description>

      <description>The Court of Gods is the home and parliament of the Returned in Hallandren. While the Returned effectively rule the nation, they are confined inside the walls of this complex in T'Telir, the capital of Hallandren.

The Court of Gods is composed of the God King's palace, a many-roomed building in the center of the court, which holds rooms in every shade of red, green and blue. Around this structure stand the various Returned's palaces, each in the colors of the Returned who resides within, as well as the priests and staff who care for them. The Lifeless barracks are situated at the base of the Court.

The political issues of Hallandren are resolved in the court, and citizens that have reached at least the First Heightening are allowed entrance to observe the choices being made in the Court Assembly.

The Court of Gods is an extravagant place in which every want or need of its Returned inhabitants are met, from luxurious food to exotic performances. The Returned live in luxury until they deem it fit to give their Divine Breath to a person with a need they find worthy. At the time of the Pahn Kahl rebellion, however, most of the Returned are content to live in excess and are apathetic to the wants and needs of the general populace. As such, much of their considerable political power lies with their priests, and no Returned has sacrificed themselves in three years, leading to some resentment among Hallandren's citizens.

A Reacher in Celebrant tries to sell a painting from the Court of Gods to Kaladin for three hundred broams worth of Stormlight. The painting, by Nenefra, seems to Kaladin to depict nine shadows, with a figure kneeling in the middle (the Unmade and Odium's champion). The painting is small, painted from thick strokes of oil. It has red and black colors, and seems sloppy, as if it had been carelessly painted with a knife.</description>

      <description>"The Dawnshards are Commands, Rysn. The will of a god."

- Nikliasorm to Rysn

The Dawnshards are the four primal Commands that Adonalsium used to create all things, which can supercharge the powers of anyone using an Invested Art, allowing for acts of magic that transcend what is normally possible, such as destroying an entire planet. They are Commands of immense power, and at least one has been secreted away to prevent unknown groups from ending the lives of billions. They have been heavily involved in the history of Roshar, but the knowledge of the true nature of the Dawnshards is very esoteric, so they are considered to be unspecified mythological objects by most people by the time Era of Solitude on Roshar.</description>

It is located east of the Unclaimed Hills, on a sea connected to the Ocean of Origins. It is situated in the former Silver Kingdom of Natanatan. The nearest population center is the city-state of New Natanan.

Although eastern Roshar has been described as a "crumbling" empty wasteland, Dawn's Shadow is known to some mapmakers in Alethkar.</description>

- Dalinar to Kaladin

The Deathbend River is a river in southern Alethkar. It runs through the Eastern Crownlands and flows into the Mevan Bay. It is one of the most consistent rivers on Roshar and does not dry up, even during the Midpeace. It is on a good caravan route.

There are six or seven villages along its southern fork including one town of note.

Gavilar and Dalinar Kholin were exploring a tributary of the Deathbend when they discovered the listeners.

As a Shardbearer of the fourth dahn Kaladin rules a section of land along the south fork of the river. Dalinar and Elhokar chose to give that plot for him since its local brightlord had died causing the land to revert to the crown.</description>

It lies a short distance east of Elendel on the Irongate River. The etymology of its name is unclear, as it is not considered to be a major port; there may be a connection to another city in the Basin named "Drypost".

It has a dedicated branch line of the Basin's railway system. Waxillium Ladrian boards a train in Dryport and confronts Edwarn Ladrian after deducing his location using coded notes taken by Miles Dagouter.</description>

      <description>Elmsdel is a city in the southeastern portion of the Elendel Basin. It is northwest of Garmet, and near to the Seran Range.

Steris mentions that travel between Elmsdel and Rashekin requires passage through Elendel as there are no rail lines bypassing the capital. This then leads to all commerce being subject to Elendel's taxes twice; once for the rail taxes and then again for entering Elendel. She argues that this is a reason for the discontentment of the rest of the Basin.

Waxillium and Steris are married in the penthouse apartment of someone who has moved to Elmsdel for a long vacation.</description>

      <description>Classical Scadrial or the classical era of Scadrial refers to the period of Scadrial's history directly preceding the Ascension of the Lord Ruler and the beginning of the Final Empire.

The general level of technology at the end of this era was more advanced than that of the Final Empire. Before Rashek's Ascension, the people of Classical Scadrial had achieved steam technology, and were close to achieving locomotive technology.

During this time period, Allomancy was almost entirely unheard of. Towards the end of the era, when the Deepness arrived, it began to snap people into Mistings; Mistborn did not appear until Rashek discovered and used the lerasium at the Well of Ascension. Feruchemy was the most wide-spread of the Metallic Arts, and even that remained isolated with the Terris people. The Terris Worldbringers in particular were known for using Feruchemy to record lore. Hemalurgy was entirely unknown of, though the Hero of Ages did wear Hemalurgically-charged piercings as a result of Ruin manipulating the Terris Prophecies.

There were many different societies and nations on classical Scadrial, including ancient Terris, the Astalsi, the Khlenni, Kordel, and the many religions that Sazed taught of during his life as a Keeper. Notable individuals born in this time period included Rashek, Kwaan, Alendi and Haddek.</description>

-, 28 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed female street juggler. Note similarity to sample 1172-89.

Dai-Gonarthis is believed to be one of the Unmade, an ancient and terrible spren of Odium. They also seem to be known as the Black Fisher.

Hessi posits in Mythica that Dai-Gonarthis may have been involved in the scouring of Aimia, although she's unsure of the specifics. She also expresses uncertainty that they are one of the Unmade at all. However, it seems likely that Dai-Gonarthis is truly the final Unmade, as Jezrien, in the guise of Ahu, refers to the Black Fisher together with two other Unmade&mdash;Re-Shephir and Moelach&mdash;during ones of his conversations with Dalinar Kholin. Additionally, the name Dai-Gonarthis is used in a Death Rattle collected by the Silent Gatherers in a manner similar to Death Rattles about the Unmade Re-Shephir and Yelig-nar.</description>

      <description>Eton, frequently referred to as the Mad Prince, was a secondary antagonist in the early drafts of Elantris. His role in the story was largely filled in the published book by Duke Telrii.

Eton, Prince Raoden's brother, was mentioned periodically in the first three quarters of the book, as an irrational man and a potential embarrassment to the court, whom King Iadon sent off to a distant plantation some time before the book began. In his youth Eton enjoyed holding mock battles with peasants, and often tormented Raoden. Raoden eventually adapted and learned to best his cruel brother, laying the groundwork for his political maneuvering with his father as a young man.

In the final act of the book, Eton arrives in Kae with an army. Sarene first sees him after she emerges from Elantris, when he rides up to the palace with a dozen soldiers, announces his claim on the throne, and sets the palace on fire. Later he meets with Hrathen, agreeing to convert to Shu-Dereth and unsettling Hrathen with the calm manner in which he contradicts both logic and himself. Hrathen and Eton meet again, and Hrathen attempts to make some progress on his goals as Eton forces him to play Stones, a game Eton claims is wildly popular but Hrathen is confident exists only in Eton's mind. Hrathen leaves the meeting increasingly frustrated.

Eton is assassinated, and his soldiers show up to try Raoden for causing Eton's death. Sarene accompanies Raoden to the trial, held next to Eton's pyre. Raoden accepts responsibility for Eton's death and makes an impassioned speech. Eton's general raises his sword to execute Raoden, closes his eyes, and swings, missing Raoden's neck by less than an inch. He explains that Eton always made his soldiers perform executions with closed eyes: a hit meant guilt, and a miss meant the accused had been innocent all along. The general declares Raoden innocent, and Raoden prepares for his coronation.</description>

Eiliz was a kingdom on Roshar during the Desolations of the Heraldic Epochs.

In one of Highprince Dalinar Kholin's visions, King Nohadon spoke of Eiliz to Dalinar, who had taken the appearance of Karm. Nohadon believed that Eiliz, like Tarma, would likely not survive the aftermath of the Desolation as too many of its people had perished.

Eiliz was not well known by the Era of Solitude, Dalinar had never heard of the place.</description>

Shallan Davar learned how to draw by reading one of his books, though Dandos himself had died three hundred years previously. In his teachings he advised that aspiring artists should paint self-portraits.

He is known to have been interested in mathematics, and to have pioneered the use of ratios in art.

Mraize used some of Oilsworn's art to bait Shalash into meeting him; she found a picture she wanted to destroy in his laundryroom, and he cornered her after she slashed it.</description>

He graduated from Rathbore Monastery as a well-trained assassin.

After Hrathen's "healing" from the Shaod and returned to the Derethi chapel in Kae, Hrathen woke up before sunrise and summoned Dothgen. Hrathen asked if Dothgen was trained in Rathbore Monastery, which he replied yes. Hrathen had use for his special skills. Dothgen asked who it was for, since only a gyorn or ragnat could make use of Rathbore-trained priests without the Wyrn's permission.

Presumably, Hrathen used Dothgen to distribute Forton's fake Shaod poison to Sarene in order for her to fall before she and Duke Roial could marry.</description>

Not much longer will I slumber within a tomb of rock. The Day of Empire is at hand, and my glory will soon shine forth, a second sun blazing forth from Fjorden."

- Wyrn Wulfden the Fourth, attributed to Jaddeth

The Day of Empire was a day prophesied by Wyrn Wulfden the Fourth when the whole world would be converted to Shu-Dereth and Jaddeth, the Derethi god, would return to Sel.

In an attempt to bring about this day, Wyrn planned to send Hrathen to warn Arelon and Teod of his impending attack, followed by a genocidal slaughter of all people of Aonic descent. This culminated in Wyrn sending Dakhor monks to Arelon and Teod for the Invasion of Arelon and the Battle of Teoras. Both these attacks failed and Arelon and Teod remained independent, so the Day of Empire has not occurred yet.</description>

      <description>The Expanse of Vibrance is a location in Shadesmar that corresponds to an unknown planet.

It is bordered by the Nexus of Imagination.

The Expanse of Vibrance is commonly thought to correspond to the world Nalthis, due to the importance of color in that planet's manifestation of Investiture, Awakening.</description>

      <description>The Rithmatist series is set on an Earth where the North American continent has been fractured into a large number of islands known as the United Isles of America. Sometime in the far past, the JoSeun people (who parallel the Korean people of our world), took over much of Europe. In the history of the Rithmatist, the Mongols were turned to work for the JoSeun empire. It borrows elements of a "steampunk" setting, incorporating springworks, a version of early industrial revolutionary technology but with more versatile applications.</description>

      <description>Derytatith was a mountain in Terris during the Final Empire. It was one of the lower peaks in the Terris mountain ranges.

Travel to Derytatith is impeded during parts of the year.

In an attempt to save their lives, Sazed lied to Vin and Elend and convinced them that the Well of Ascension was located at Derytatith. He encouraged them to leave Luthadel and seek out the Well, arguing that their absence from the city would allow for a peaceful transition of power when Straff invaded. The pair agreed, setting off towards the Terris mountains the next morning, not realizing that Sazed believed that the city would fall and had fed them lies in order to spare them.</description>

Eonic is one of the "incomplete" Elantrians living in the crumbling city during the period after the Reod. As an Elantrian, he is of Aonic descent, and his name is based on Aon Eon.

He is among the skilled workers enlisted by Raoden to help improve the quality of life in New Elantris, and is noted as one of the few Elantrians to remain committed to Raoden's plans after Sarene begins handing out food at the city gates. When Raoden asks Sarene for steel, she spitefully sends him thousands of bent nails, but he believes Eonic will find a use for them. It is not known if Eonic survived to see the restoration of Elantris and AonDor.</description>

      <description>Evensong was an orbital platform hanging between Saturn and Uranus. It was the most remote of all the Outer Platforms, the farthest human outpost in deep-space. It is months away from Earth by ship.

Evensong was a flat piece of metal, fifty miles long, with buildings on both the top and bottom. The area on the top is called Topside. It was surrounded by a bubble of air, and ESG generators (Element-specific gravity generators) give it gravity, while fusion generators also help to make it habitable. Many of Evensong's skyrises and towers were linked by walkways. It was the frontier of humanity's conquest in space. But despite how futuristic and advanced it is, it still had slums. The slums have drying clothes and ragged drapes hung from the buildings and pedestrians walking more than in other areas. Orson Ansed feels the area has a sense of despair to it.

The buildings on Evensong were built of rich telanium, a super-light, silvery metal that does not corrode or fall apart. Most of the buildings had been prefabricated with the platform. The buildings were spacious, well constructed, and sleek. Most buildings were poorly-lit, and its distance from the sun kept it in a perpetual state of twilight.

Evensong has a police force. Orson Ansed is a captain on it and Ken Harris is a relatively new officer. Evensong also has a research facility for the Phone Company. Denise Carlson was a researcher there before she disappeared.</description>

      <description>"Technology is limited. Only the mind is infinite."

- Varvax proverb

Cytonics, sometimes called cytonic abilities, a defect or a deviation, are a set of psionic abilities used by numerous sapient beings, among them Jason Write and Spensa Nightshade. A person capable of using them is called a cytonic. In humans, those abilities have lasted centuries and have continued to pass genetically since the time of the Phone Company until the occupation of Detritus by the descendants of the Defiant. All known alien species have the capacity to produce cytonics, and a few are all-cytonic.</description>

      <description>Dereth is the founder of the Shu-Dereth religion. Though his Fjordell name is more well-known in modern times, his original JinDo name is DeHwo.

Dereth lived in JinDo anciently and studied as a disciple of Keseg along with Korath. Keseg taught Dereth and his other disciples about unity, founding the Shu-Keseg religion. When Dereth and Korath left JinDo to teach in the lands to the north, they interpreted his teachings differently, which led to the foundation of Shu-Dereth and Shu-Korath. Dereth took Keseg's teachings about unity to mean that people should be united through obedience.

He presumably wrote the Do-Dereth, one of the holy books of Shu-Dereth, although over the years its text has been altered at least to include references to Jaddeth.</description>

      <description>Dragons were a sentient species of lizard on Earth. They seemed to keep themselves hidden from the Hushlands.

Dragons can breath fire and climb on walls. They can also grow large enough to swallow a bus. At least some of them have horns. The Dragonaut, a glass vehicle shaped like a dragon, is described as snakelike and sleek. It's head is angular, with sharp lines. It has three sets of wings running down its body, all flapping at the same time. At the end, it has a long tail.

The draco-human treaty between dragons and humans prevents humans from violating their dens. Dragons serving a prison sentence are used as transportation in the Free Kingdoms. When this is done, their wings are taken from them until the end of the sentence. As transportation, they carry gondola baskets, using orientation glass, on their back.</description>

For a nation ruled by a self-proclaimed divinity, the empire has experienced a frightening number of colossal leadership errors. Most of these have been successfully covered up, and can only be found in the metalminds of Feruchemists or on the pages of banned texts. However, one only need look to the near past to note such blunders as the Massacre at Devanex, the revision of the Deepness Doctrine, and the relocation of the Renates peoples."

- The Book of False Dawn, written by Deluse Couvre

Deluse Couvre was an author during the Final Empire on Scadrial.

He wrote numerous books, including Book of the False Dawn--a book that any Keeper could quote, as it damned the Lord Ruler's leadership blunders over the centuries.

Deluse went on to write even more damning books about the Final Empire, and though he never blasphemed against Allomancy, the Steel Ministry made an exception and executed him anyway.</description>

      <description>"His Divine Majesty Susebron the Fourth died to cure the plague of distrentia that struck T'Telir fifty years ago"

- Llarimar to Lightsong

Distrentia is an illness on Nalthis.

It is a disease of the bowels. A plague of distrentia hit T'Telir fifty years before Siri became queen of Hallandren--circa 277--and the previous God King died, giving up his Breath to cure the plague.

When Lightsong quipped that the God King had died to cure "a few tummy aches," Llarimar disagreed, indicating that distrentia is severe.</description>

She expressed frustration regarding Dalinar's restrictive social policies following the Alethi Codes of War. She even suggested that Dalinar should abdicate, angering Adolin. She unsuccessfully tried to change the subject, and Toral interceded to tell Adolin that many people shared Eshava's opinion.</description>

      <description>Cosahn is a skaa servant, and a member of Mansion Renoux's staff in Fellise. She is middle-aged and relatively tall.

Some time after Vin joined Kelsier's crew, Cosahn and Sazed waited for her in the kitchens of the mansion. When Vin arrived, Sazed introduced her to Cosahn.

Cosahn then studied the girl's appearance, as Sazed had asked her to cut her hair. He thought it was now long enough to be cut stylishly. Cosahn didn't disagree, though she warned that she wasn't sure how much she could improve its appearance as she couldn't 'perform miracles'. Sazed nodded at this. Vin looked dubiously between them, not knowing what they were talking about, and he explained that Cosahn would be cutting her hair.

She gestured for Vin to take a seat, and when she did, began running her hands through Vin's hair and tsked at how ill-kept it was. She started to cut it, complimenting it as she did so and expressing her disappointment in how badly Vin took care of it, remarking that the women of the court would be envious of such hair.

Sazed promised that they would take better care of it. This appeased Cosahn, who nodded to herself as she worked. She took her time, trimming Vin's bangs as well, and while she worked Vin and Sazed chatted.

As she was finishing, Kelsier arrived. He complimented her skills, and she received his praise with some embarrassment, flattered. Vin requested a mirror, which Cosahn provided. Kelsier once again complimented her work, for she had evened out the hair, gotten rid of the snags and gotten it to lay flat.

Cosahn told him she was not yet done, and so Kelsier urged her to continue. She did so, as he and Sazed stepped outside to speak privately.

Later on, after Vin's hair had grown some more, Cosahn cut and styled it again so that it fell around her ears, with a slight curl.</description>

      <description>"They thought art drew one closer to God, they were most interested in color and hue, and they were fond of writing poetry describing the colors they saw in the world around them."

- Sazed preaching to Clubs

Dadradah was an ancient religion from Scadrial.

The Dadradah followers were found through many countries and peoples. They believed that there was only one God, and that practicing art was the only right way to worship or draw closer to that God, being an artist even was a higher calling than being a priest. Dadradah followers had a fascination for color and hue, and were fond of poetry that described this.

While preparing for the Battle of Luthadel, Sazed proposed the Dadradah religion to Clubs. He thought this suitable because Clubs's woodworking was also a form of art. Sazed then gave him a simple wooden disk with the carved picture of a brush on it, which was a symbol of the Dadradah faith.

When Sazed recreated Scadrial during the Final Ascension he was able to restore the plants, sky and landscape to their original state, using Dadradah poems as a guideline.</description>

When an Epic uses their powers, it corrupts them and turns them evil unless they can overcome their greatest fear.</description>

He would later join the Reckoners, a group of ordinary people that are humanity's only chance of combating the Epics, and concoct a plan in taking Steelheart once and for all. After successfully taking down the High Epic, all David had to worry about was all the other Epics wreaking havoc.</description>

      <description>Cody is a member of the Reckoners.

"I fight because I was a cop, and I took an oath."

- Cody explaining to David his reasons for being a Reckoner.

He is a wiry man in his early forties with a distinctive Southern accent, often wears camouflage, and does not have a specific role within the Reckoners -- instead, he does odd jobs and 'fills in the gaps with mayonnaise', as he puts it. He was a policeman in Nashville before it was annexed by the Coven. He is from the South, although his family is from Scotland. He has never been to Scotland, but uses Scottish slang and terminology anyway, despite his having a definite Southern accent.

He is fond of making absurd claims about topics such as his own past accomplishments, Scottish culture and history, and the "wee daemons" who allegedly power mobile phones and other technology. The extent to which he believes his own stories is ambiguous, although Prof suspected that he only did it to see how people would react. He also adds other commentaries on the Irish and Australian cultures, but not as often as the Scottish mythology.</description>

      <description>The setting of The Reckoners series is a twenty-first century alternate Earth. Visible in the sky is a large red object called Calamity (a high-powered Gifting Epic), which appeared twelve years before the events of Steelheart. One year after the emergence of Calamity, the Epics, super-powered humans, appeared.

At the start of Steelheart, the High Epics, with their prime invincibility and incredible superpowers, are the de-facto rulers of humanity.

It is a Core Possibility in the Reckoners Multiverse.</description>

      <description>"I'm an idiot, mam. Not a fool."

- Dob

Dob is an elderly stable hand at Silence's waystop in the Forests of Hell on Threnody.

Dob takes care of the horses of people who stay at the waystop. He is under standing orders to leave watering for last, in case Silence wants to add wetleek sap to their water in order to track bounties. He sleeps in the stable with the horses.

Dob has worked at the waystop since before William Montane's death; he is a loyal man. However, Dob is not terribly intelligent, and Silence Montane thinks that he has no idea that she is the White Fox. On the contrary, Dob is fully aware of her secret identity. When Silence returns from hunting Chesterton Divide, carrying William Ann, both injured from the withering touch of shades, Dob pours silver dust on the two of them to save their lives.

After his chores are done, Dob likes to smoke his pipe on the waystop's porch.</description>

      <description>Enforcement is an authoritarian police force used by Steelheart to rule Newcago. Enforcement is known to be commanded by the Epic Conflux, but it is later revealed that he only acted as a battery, without any real power over its members.

They use energy weapons, Copters, and occasionally huge robotic armor suits. These have two rotary barrels, one on each arm.

Enforcement is composed of roughly 50 small groups, called Cores, which typically has five members - three infantry, one specialist (sniper, medic, etc) and one minor epic.

Known enforcement members include David's friend, Roy, and an Epic, Refractionary, who was killed while David was retrieving his notebooks.

After Steelheart died and all the Epics fled, The Reckoners starting accepting the allegiance of most of Enforcement to them to help them control Newcago. They now keep peace in Newcago.</description>

Corberon is a person who lived before the Recreance on Roshar.

Corberon was referred to in Words of Radiance in relation to the Truthwatchers. Corberon was mentioned as having "disagreements," though it is not clear whether Corberon had a disagreement with the Truthwatchers, or Corberon was a Truthwatcher who had a disagreement with others. However, in this incident, the Truthwatchers' silence on this matter came from tactfulness instead of disdain.</description>

- Dalksi upon the mention of her application on becoming Prime

Dalksi is an Azish vizier on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

In, after the assassination of two Prime Aqasixes by Szeth, Dalksi attended the holy conclave in the Bronze Palace to chose a new Prime. Dalksi, like many, feared for her life and did not want to be chosen as the new Prime. In order to avoid being chosen, she submitted a poor application, misspelling several words in her essay among other intentional mistakes. Another vizier attempted to compliment Dalksi's essay, but Dalksi denied the compliment, claiming that Axikk's essay was superior.

During her time in the palace, Lift got to know Dalksi better, although she never bothered to learn her name, referring to her as Dalky instead.

She is one of Yanagawn's highest advisers, and is present when the Azish fleet escapes Thaylen City prior to the Battle of Thaylen Field. She asks Yanagawn what he means when he says that Lift is 'the other kind of smart'. She then opens the door for Vono to report that Lift had escaped.

Dalksi has an odd-looking nose that resembles a spigot. Her hair is powder white, and she is the oldest of Yanagawn's advisers, but isn't the most senior.</description>

Dreder is an associate of Shallan's mother.

Dreder's association with her mother is one of the things Shallan wishes never happened. It is possible that they are the Skybreaker acolyte who Shallan's mother is intimate with, or the person with Shallan's mother when she died.</description>

He is first mentioned to Adolin by Jakamav, who describes him as being boastful and insisting that his skill is higher than his ranking would show, and that he would accept an offer which others refuse in order to stand out. Despite this Jakamav still warns Adolin that he is actually skilled and not completely full of himself, so he should watch out when dueling him.

      <description>Ethid is a scion in Azir on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

Scion Ethid likely spent much time wandering from village to village in Azir, blessing each of them. In, Scion Ethid attended the holy conclave in the Bronze Palace of Azimir to choose a new Prime Aqasix. Ethid was asked by a vizier to write a prayer of guidance to Yaezir asking for help choosing the correct Prime, as the previous two had been assassinated by the One All White.

Ethid is a scholar that studies men of conquest, especially great kings like Gavilar. Upon the arrival of the Knights Radiant she starts to study them. She intends to create detailed drawings of each Radiant Order's Spren and tries to study Lift. She also has been tracking the Herald Nale.

She is a scholar of the Veristitalian group, and a friend of Jasnah Kholin and Jochi.

Some colleagues of Jasnah, likely including Ethid, convinced the Stump to visit Azimir and let them make sketches of her spren.</description>

Denocax salve can be used to encourage skin growth on wounds, such as skin that has been stripped away by prolonged exposure to a highstorm.

After surviving his judgement by the Stormfather in 1173, a semi-conscious Kaladin thought that he should apply a denocax salve to his wounds.</description>

      <description>Chicken is the name used by many Rosharan languages -- except the Shin and the Unkalaki -- to refer to all species of birds. Only some are what would be called chickens in any other part of the cosmere. The term coming to mean all birds is a result of Vorin languages tending towards generalization, similar to how all alcohols became wines and all small creatures became cremlings.

Chickens are not native to Roshar, but were brought to the planet during the initial human migration from Ashyn. They live mainly in Shinovar, with very few found further east and no undomesticated ones as far as Alethkar. This being said, wild chickens can be found in the East - for instance, geese live in the Horneater Peaks, and Dalinar saw chickens during his visit to the Valley.</description>

He is a computer expert, and helped Ivans talk Stephen through fixing a large computer system during the Longway Incident. He always wears sunglasses, even while inside or when the sun isn't out. He helps Stephen to create and maintain some of the high-tech programs he keeps on his phone.

Just after Armando turned into a nightmare, Chin hung out in the game room of Stephen's mansion. Later, Stephen asked Chin to run a sketch through facial recognition, but Chin declined, saying he already knew that the face belonged to Kyle Walters. While infiltrating Walters and Ostman Detention Enterprises, Stephen calls Chin for help exploiting the security system, which he provides. When Stephen is in the simulation of the mob raid, Chin speaks directly into Stephen's ear and helps him to trap the WODE employees in with him. Moments later, he dies or goes nightmare, along with all of the other remaining aspects but Jenny.</description>

He is killed by David's father on the Day of Annexation.

He was tall and lean, but solid. He was muscled and toned in a way that could be seen through his clothes.

He has the ability to disintegrate living things by pointing at them, though their bones were always left unharmed. Worn items (like a holstered gun or a swaddling blanket) also appear to be unaffected. He is also speculated to have a second ability, one that was never shown, but appears to require physical contact and can be assumed to be more powerful than his first, as he attempts to use it on Steelheart despite his first being ineffective.</description>

      <description>Dark One is a multimedia storytelling enterprise based on an initial outline written by Brandon Sanderson. The initial plan called for a series of graphic novels, to be published by Vault Comics, a television series by FremantleMedia North America and Random House Studio, supplementary novels written by Brandon, and a podcast. So far, the first book of the graphic novels has been published and it is unclear where the other components stand. The story takes places both on Earth and in an alternate world called Mirandus, with the two worlds influencing each other, even though only some in each are aware of the other. Though the protagonist, Paul Tanasin, is from Earth, there are prophecies of him in Mirandus -- prophecies claiming that he will be their destroyer, the Dark One.</description>

      <description>"It passed directly underneath. Sak chirped quietly from Dusk’s shoulder; the second bird seemed to have some sense of the danger. Creatures like the shadow did not hunt by smell or sight, but by sensing the minds of prey."

- Dusk, about shadow

A deepwalker, also called shadow, is a large sea-dwelling predatory creature on First of the Sun, only living in the waters near the Pantheon.

Like many creatures native to the Pantheon, it hunts by sensing minds of other living creatures, making protection bestowed by mind-shielding Aviar essential for unarmed boats. They hunt in the open sea, but are also capable of exploding out of the water to lay their hands on a prey on the beach.

A deepwalker is as wide as six narrowboats tied together, and possesses something like claws or tusks that are sharp enough to gouge rocks.

The ironhull class of ship can successfully attack and defend themselves from deepwalker threats; they managed to kill one during the expedition to Patji by the Northern Interests Trading Company.</description>

By the time Elend met Vin, his mother had presumably died; he spoke of her in the past tense. The circumstances of her death are not known. She had significant influence on Elend, and he took after her more than Straff.

Elend told Vin that his mother was fond of telling him that "it does gentlemen good to wait upon a lady's whims". Vin said that she sounded like a wise woman, although Elend countered that she was not wise enough to avoid marrying Straff.</description>

      <description>The Davar Soulcaster is a Soulcasting fabrial in the possession of House Davar.

It is used to create mineral deposits on lands owned by House Davar, and is damaged when Balat Davar attempts to stab his father, Lin Davar.

Shallan discovers that her father was in league with the Ghostbloods, and the Soulcaster was theirs. A group of Ghostbloods went to House Davar to ask for it back, along with their house steward, Luesh, who was one of the Ghostbloods. The Soulcaster was already broken at that time. Shallan and her brothers come up with a plan for Shallan to switch it out with the Soulcaster of Jasnah Kholin and give that one to the Ghostbloods, before they get too angry. Shallan travels to Kharbranth, is taken on as Jasnah's ward, and swaps her the broken Soulcaster with Jasnah's. However, she reveals to Jasnah that she stole it when she is poisoned by the ardent Kabsal. Jasnah then uses her Elsecaller Soulcasting abilities to save Shallan's life.

Shallan lost it to the ocean when she sinks the Wind's Pleasure.</description>

      <description>"Many cultures speak of the so-called Death Rattles that sometimes overtake people as they die. Tradition ascribes them to the almighty, but I find too many of them to be seemingly prophetic. This will be my most contentious assertion I am sure but I think these are the effects of Moelach persisting in our current times. Proof is easy to provide: the effect is regionalized, and tends to move across Roshar. This is the roving of the Unmade."

- Hessi's Mythica, page 170

Death Rattles are a phenomenon related to the Unmade Moelach. His presence causes some dying individuals to experience precognitive events in the form of cryptic utterances, in the final moments of life. This effect occurs only in the area around Moelach, who tends to move around Roshar. Death Rattles were apparently moderately common in Shinovar at some time between and, as Szeth recounts the phenomenon. The emergence of the Death Rattles in the East appears to coincide with the expedition of King Gavilar Kholin of Alethkar where the Parshendi were first encountered in. Later, during, Moelach and the Rattles moved to the Horneater Peaks.</description>

      <description>Dawnslight is an Epic in the city of Babilar who feeds the people by making fruits grow faster. He also caused the spraypaint in the city to glow and radios to run without batteries. He began operating shortly after Calamity appeared. To the people of Babilar, he is practically a god, and, due to his seeming generosity, is loved rather than feared, though no one knows for sure if he even exists.

He can communicate with people in the city by causing vines to grow fortune cookies with messages inside them, though this appears to be an uncommon occurrence.

In reality, Dawnslight is a permanently bedridden invalid. While very young, and before obtaining his powers, he fell into a life-long coma. For some reason, he is able to use his powers without becoming corrupted.

He was treated by a doctor in the same room as Regalia.</description>

When David Charleston first tried to join the Reckoners, Prof was the first to seriously consider his proposal to assassinate Steelheart. Tia, still skeptical, warned Prof to "remember what happened with Duskwatch". It is possible Duskwatch had tried and failed to do something similar to what David was suggesting, or that Duskwatch was an Epic whom the Reckoners had suffered adverse consequences for trying to kill.</description>

      <description>Exel is a member of the Reckoners cell based in Babilar. Exel gathers information from the inhabitants of Babilar, and is recognized by people in the city. Much of this skill in this can be assumed to come from his experience as a pre-Calamity government agent. As a former mortician, Exel visits funerals and often makes morbid (but well-natured) jokes about how someone would look as a corpse. He is described as an extremely large man by David.

After Prof's prevention of Babilar's destruction and subsequent corruption from overuse of his Epic abilities, Exel was brutally crushed to death, along with Val, by their former leader's forcefield abilities.</description>

      <description>Dragonsteel Prime was Brandon Sanderson's seventh novel and was written as part of his Masters Thesis when working towards a Master's Degree in Creative Writing. Five copies are currently held in the Harold B Lee Library at Brigham Young University, four of which are available for circulation. After positive response to his release of The Way of Kings Prime, Brandon has discussed a possible release of this draft as part of a "Sanderson Curiosities" series.

Brandon has stated that it was not his best work. He plans to rewrite and publish the series after the completion of The Stormlight Archive. Sections of the book, including locations such as the Shattered Plains, were later re-purposed in The Way of Kings, but Brandon considers some of the other events to be canon. He had some trepidation over removing the Shattered Plains because, though it was not as essential to the story, he felt it was the part of the book that worked best.

In 2007, Brandon began work on a rewrite of the Dragonsteel series. He began with The Liar of Partinel and The Lightweaver of Rens, which take place approximately five hundred years before the events of Dragonsteel Prime, which he then planned to rewrite and release as 'The Eternal War'. However, after finishing Liar he was unsatisfied with the result and shelved the series for a future date. Since 'The Eternal War' would begin the main story arc, at the time he also intended to call that book 'Dragonsteel Book 1' and expect the readers to connect it to the previous two books to avoid the confusion of starting his story arc with Book 3. The story takes place on Yolen and focuses on Jerick, but also includes other viewpoint characters such as Topaz, also known as Hoid.</description>

      <description>Elashe is a historic Aonic princess, descendant of King Raoshem. She was among the first people to be taken by the Shaod becoming Elantrian. She claimed to have seen Aon Ehe inscribed on a coal in her hearth the day after she was taken. This has led to the belief that a rock or piece of coal inscribed with Aon Ehe is good luck and provides protection against winter spirits.</description>

Churnrock is the name of a mineral found on Alornia. It has the property of changing colors under physical pressure. It was gifted to Kairominas by the Larkians, and used to line the floor of his portal room. It was placed there because the shifting colors unsettle Kai's stomach, and he rarely uses the portal room.</description>

The cube is saturated with magic, and as a result the people of the cube are born with innate magic, the manifestation of which depends on the Face where they were born. The people of Dawnface can bend magic to their will, creating powerful effects through sorcery, unlike the small effects of Sixthfacer knacks.</description>

      <description>"Technically, dragons—being sentient beings—likely have a suicide rate similar to other intelligent creatures. So perhaps this one will kill himself. It’s statistically possible, anyway."

- Skip, about dragons

Dragons are sentient inhabitants of the cube. Presumably they originate from Drakeface, which is completely inhabited by dragons, with additional populations in Sixthface and Dawnface. They vary in size, with 30 feet long being considered rather large. In addition, there exist many varieties of a dragon, such as the Grummager, distinguished by the black shading of the scales that glowed radiant colors when struck by light, as well as the more webbed pattern on the skin of the wings.

Dragons are capable of flight, and are quite agile whilst airborne, but they lose most of that agility while on land, and can only get off the ground with a running start.

While one of the dragons said that they are unable to digest anything but humans, it is unknown how much truth there is in that statement.

Dragons have two stomachs, one for food, and one filled with valuables like gold and jewels, the latter feature making them an attractive target for dragon hunters.</description>

- Bastille

Dinosaurs are a sapient species in the Free Kingdoms. They are native to Nalhalla.

They are much smaller than the dinosaurs that presumably lived in the Hushlands millions of years ago, with Tyrannosaurus Rex reaching five to six feet tall. They also have varying coloration (green, orange, etc). They wear trousers and speak with a Nalhallan (British in Hushlands) accent. The majority of them appear to be refined, calm, and well-mannered, sometimes to a fault, which is why they are considered to be useless in a crisis situation.

The Librarians in the Hushlands execute dinosaurs, enlarge their bones and place them into rock formations for archaeologists to dig up, perpetuating the lie that dinosaurs were prehistoric creatures.</description>

      <description>Donton is the minister of public affairs in Elendel and a member of Governor Replar Innate's executive staff.

In a meeting that Marasi attends, Donton suggests that House Lekal could be responsible for the assassination attempt on Innate, but the sanitation director and secretary of education quickly dismiss this theory.</description>

He is with them on the train to New Seran and questions why Marasi and Steris have earplugs handy during the shootout. He asks what happened to Wax's last valet, and continues to interrogate Marasi while she clears the train of hostiles. Once the violence was over, Wax saw him with three nurses complaining about having been in such a situation.

After returning to Elendel, Wax awakens after the explosion that kills Mister Suit and sees that Drewton has laid out Wax's possessions on a dressing table, and presumes that it is so Wax can choose what to dispose of. Amongst the things is the coin that Hoid gave Wax.</description>

      <description>The Dynasty is an empire that spans multiple nations on the Darkside of Taldain.

The Dynasty exerts a great deal of control over the entirety of Darkside, to the point that Dynastic is the first language of all Darksiders. The current ruler of the Dynasty, Emperor Skathan, intentionally impedes the spread of technology and knowledge between provinces of the Dynasty in order to maintain dominance. He also attempts to prevent trade and interaction with Dayside to hide the fact that there is notable traffic between the continents.

The Dynasty is more technologically advanced than Dayside, as evidenced by their development of firearms. Paired with their perceived social development, citizens of the Dynasty generally consider Daysiders to be uncivilized.</description>

      <description>Dorim vines are a type of flora native to the Dayside of Taldain. The vines draw their water from the water table or some other subterranean source. For this reason, deep sand is uninhabited by dorim vines.

Dorim vines carry a significant amount of water within themselves as a defense mechanism against certain creatures native to Dayside, such as sandlings. These creatures have terken skin or carapaces that dissolve if they come into contact with water.

Daysiders use dorim vines as a water source. Pouring water onto sand draws nearby vines out of the ground. Cutting the vine releases a flow of water. Fitting cut vines back together allows the vine to repair itself. Despite much of Dayside being covered in sand the regions where dorim vines grow are not considered desert.</description>

Ekel and Jix were armed, but they did not have to fight since Lin declined to pay the massive debt and told Mill that he could take Jushu. After Mill departed, Ekel likely returned to his post on the manor grounds.

Ekel was presumably one of the Davar household guards that were replaced after the Ghostbloods took interest in Lin and Luesh became his steward.</description>

      <description>Dean Knighthawk is the owner of Knighthawk Foundry.

"Dean Knighhawk" is actually an alias, as he thought his given name was stupid. He was born paralyzed, and can only move his head. Instead, he uses epic technology to assume the powers of a telepathic puppeteer, The Wooden Soul. With his human-sized wooden puppet, he can carry himself around. He was friends with Jonathan Phaedrus prior to Calamity, as was his wife Amala. She became an Epic, and succumbed to Calamity's darkness. Phaedrus had to kill her. Since then, Knighthawk has been gathering the powers of healing epics, but none can revive her. After Phaedrus turned evil, Knighthawk agreed to help David Charleston if he would help Knighthawk get Phaedrus' healing powers. He spent the rest of the book monitoring things with his hacking abilities and texting David.

After the events of Calamity, Knighthawk did in fact get his wife back, possibly by Prof's healing powers, although the complete story is more complicated.</description>

The flight started in chapter 4 1/2 and lasted until chapter 42, however, Alcatraz forgot to include the between chapters in the book, so we only know of the flight what they say about it afterward. They supposedly went into space, fought a squid-wombat, and many other things. In the end, it crash-landed in a jungle near Tuki Tuki.</description>

      <description>Darrelnai was a location in the domain of King Wednegon, after the Ascension of the Lord Ruler, and presumably prior to that in Classical Scadrial. It may have been the name of Wednegon's kingdom, or a city within it.

Prior to the Ascension, the Deepness hurt Darrelnai's food stores, which caused persistent issues after the Lord Ruler's rise. Wednegon blames this lack of food for why his soldiers could not fight off the koloss. It is said that Wednegon was the last leader to fight off the Lord Ruler in military combat, so it is not clear how long Darrelnai survived if the Deepness still affected it so long after the Ascension.</description>

      <description>"We're spren, but my kind—cultivationspren—are not very important. We don’t have a kingdom, or even cities, of our own."

- Wyndle

Cultivationspren are a type of sapient spren on Roshar. They are capable of forming a Nahel Bond, granting people the powers of the Edgedancers.</description>

Lord Drapen attended Lord Waxillium Ladrian and Lady Steris Harms's initial attempt at a public wedding. When the wedding was sabotaged by Wayne, Lord Drapen was caught in the deluge of water that flooded through the ceiling. Afterwards, as Wax helped him to his carriage, Drapen complained that the water had ruined his pistol and that it would need to be cleaned and oiled.</description>

According to Marasi, he once conducted a sociological study that found that people in crowds give constables a wide berth, mimicking the behavior of groups of animals in the vicinity of a predator. During a trip to New Seran, Wax realizes that his height, clothing, and weapons make him very conspicuous even though he is not identifiable as a constable, and people indeed seem to get out of his way.</description>

      <description>Deep sand refers to areas on the Dayside of Taldain with particularly deep layers of sand. "Few people—even Kerztians—are foolish enough to wander into deep sand."

- Kenton

Deep sand is considered very dangerous because it is frequently inhabited by sandlings. Areas of deep sand are also generally void of water because dorim vines are unable to grow. This extra space and lack of water is what allows sandlings to survive.

Northern Dayside consists mostly of deep sand.

Kerztians bury the bodies of their dead in deep sand.</description>

He was fiercely devoted to his older brother, Panos, and decided to stalk Stephen Leeds in order to discover what he knew about Panos's death. He led Stephen to his house to allow Stephen to talk to his mother. Because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, he got captured with Stephen. He feared death.</description>

Cultivation's Perpendicularity is the only known stable perpendicularity on Roshar. Like all perpendicularities, Cultivation's Perpendicularity allows for travel between Roshar's Physical Realm and Shadesmar. Although it is possible to enter Roshar through other means, they are known to be highly unstable; as such, this appears to be the main method by which worldhoppers arrive at the planet.</description>

Defiance lies at the end of a long, twisting road, atop cliffs overlooking the Ocean of Origins. It has endured for over one hundred years, and has been in Puuli's family for at least three generations. The two-story building is short and squat, built stout with good stonework in order to resist the buffet of highstorms at their peak strength as they make landfall. A layer of crem on the outside prevents leaks. The ground level includes room for Puuli to store his wagon. The lighthouse's fire burns on the second floor, where mirrors are used to shine light out of an opening at night.</description>

- Urv

The Covad Fragment is an old untranslated manuscript thought to be written in Dawnchant.

After Dalinar and Navani released information about how to translate Dawnchant, many scholars started working on it in earnest. Ellista proposed that some of the more challenging fragments were potentially not Dawnchant, but rather its script being used to phonetically transcribe other languages. Ardent Urv, who studied the Covad, decided that this was an example of such a fragment.</description>

      <description>"Adolin was confronted by a figure in glistening black Shardplate, a large hammer strapped to its back. The helm had stylized eyebrows like knives sweeping backward, and the Plate was skirted with a triangular pattern of interlocking scales."

- Adolin's impression of Cvaderln.

Cvaderln is a set of Shardplate held by the kingdom of Thaylenah.

It is Thaylen for "shell of Cva" and is painted gloss black. The helmet has Thaylen eyebrows which are stylized into backwards-pointing knives, and the legs are covered by a scale armor skirt.

During the Battle of Thaylen Field, Hrdalm wears Cvaderln, armed with a large warhammer. He fought the thunderclast Kai-garnis and some Fused along with support from Adolin, who lent him Maya for a time. At one point his helm cracked but he continues to fight, and helps Renarin remove all of Kai-garnis' limbs before Renarin forces her to leave.</description>

      <description>Dru is a slender Alethi man on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

Dru worked in the district quartermaster's office. After the discovery of Urithiru, Dru relocated there along with most of the other Alethi from the warcamps on the Shattered Plains. At some point he began seeing Drehy, one of the men of Bridge Four.

After the Battle of Thaylen Field, Dru boiled bandages for the wounded. As Kaladin had returned from Kholinar without Drehy, Dru believed that he had been killed and his eyes were reddened with grief. Lopen saw him working and patted him on his shoulder in an attempt to comfort him. He was presumably reunited with Drehy after Kaladin helped recover him, Gavinor and the others from the Frostlands.</description>

      <description>Estnatil is a Thaylen Shardbearer and a highguard who lived in Thaylen City on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

Estnatil possess a Shardblade and as such is a member of one of the eight Thaylen houses to own Shards.

Estnatil likely received his Shard from his father in his youth. After receiving his Shard, he served as a member of the highguard, protecting the Thaylen throne. During the Battle of Thaylen Field, Estnatil was standing on the city wall when the thunderclast Kai-garnis broke it. He was killed and he and his Shardblade were buried beneath the rubble of the wall. After patching the city wall, Jasnah Kholin detected his Shardblade and Soulcast the rubble covering it to smoke. Adolin Kholin gave Estnatil's Blade to Fen's son Kdralk, ordering him to gather men and attempt to hold the Low Ward of Thaylen City.</description>

      <description>Captain Deedanor is an Alethi man who is the platoon leader of the Seventh Platoon of the Kholinar Wall Guard on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

Deedanor's second in command was Lieutenant Noromin, who commanded the platoon in the event of Deedanor's absence.

Deedanor was sitting at the dinner table when Kaladin began questioning Highmarshal Azure on her identity and past. He stared at Kaladin slack-jawed at the boldness of his questions. When an attack on the wall by the Fused interrupted them, Deedanor went up to the wall with the rest of the platoon. One of the Fused pinned Deedanor to the wall's battlements with her lance and then lifted him and tossed him off the wall. Deedanor screamed as he fell and died upon hitting the ground. Kaladin considered using his Surgebinding to save him, but he decided that it was not worth the risk and instead began organizing the platoon's defense.</description>

He is a fidgety man and usually wears a typical stormwarden robe. He is meticulous in his daily task of administering and evaluating Taravangian's tests, always taking care to ensure that the King completes the exams correctly. This annoys Taravangian on days when he is particularly intelligent; however, Taravangian also considers him a dear friend on his less intelligent days.

Dukar is a dedicated member of the Diagram and discusses its meaning with fellow Diagramists Adrotagia and Mrall. He doesn’t wholeheartedly believe in Taravangian's interpretations of the Diagram and speculates that Graves's interpretation may have been correct. He is keenly aware of the dangerous situation the Diagram faces after Taravangian's revelation to Dalinar Kholin about his role in Szeth's failed assassination attempts.

When the Diagram is disbanded, Dukar wishes to stay with Taravangian and continue testing him, but he is commanded to leave. Taravangian believes that after his betrayal in Emul, the tests will no longer be useful, and anyone remaining close to him will be punished.</description>

Dovcanti wrote an epic about the False Desolation, describing clashes between humans and Voidbringers after Aharietiam. The epic was considered pseudohistorical by the Vorin church because the ardentia did not believe any Voidbringers survived Aharietiam. However, recent revelations about the Heralds' abandonment of the Oathpact and the restoration of the singers by the Everstorm lend more credence to Dovcanti's work.</description>

      <description>The setting of the novella Snapshot is an alternate Earth in 2018. The story focuses on a single day spent inside a Snapshot, a perfect recreation of another, earlier day, where Anthony Davis and Chaz attempt to track a serial killer. Besides having the snapshot device, the Earth in Snapshot differs from real Earth in a few ways. Self-driving cars appear to be popular; about half of all cars in New Clipperton are self-driving and some places, including Mexico City, have already outlawed manually-driven cars. New Clipperton and Mexico City are both Independent City-States. The Restored American Union is the original builder of the Snapshot program but decided to leave it when they pulled out of New Clipperton. Otherwise, it appears to resemble real-world Earth in 2018.</description>

      <description>A Deviation is a difference between the actual events and the recreated version inside a Snapshot. When evidence found in Snapshots is presented at trial a Deviation Percentage is calculated and presented. Deviations can be caused by anything small or large and are impossible to completely eliminate. Cops in Snapshots are required to stay in safe houses when not investigating as to minimize Deviations but even this sometimes fails. One day Davis tried to eliminate all Deviations by locking himself in a room all day, but while slamming the door to the room he woke up a woman in the next room and caused a Deviation level of 20 percent.

Going in or out of a Snapshot can cause huge Deviations. The best way to observe a Snapshot without Deviations is to insert people at the very beginning and try not to mess it up.</description>

      <description>This timeline is a chart of expected Everstorm arrival times, along with an explanation of the calculations involved.

= Everstorm Arrival Times =

The Everstorm's arrival at different locations can be predicted based on the typical cycle. The tenth Everstorm arrived approximately 4 days early and the regular cycle seems to have resumed with the eleventh Everstorm.

The times provided assume a 20-hour clock, with "00:00" as midnight and "10:00" as noon, and use 50 minutes per hour. Dates follow the typical Rosharan convention of 10 months per year, 10 weeks per month, and 5 days per week. All times are highly speculative, as the precise timing depends on the accuracy of the assumptions made and (more importantly) on the imprecise and variable nature of the Everstorm's movement.

<references group=Note/>

= Basis and Assumptions =

This section details how the dates and times in the above table were determined.

We believe that the Everstorm follows a great circle path around Roshar, extending outward in each direction, normal to the path, such that it covers every landmass on Roshar that we know of. Thus we assume a great circle path which crosses roughly through the center of mainland Roshar. This is the greatest point of potential error in the calculation as the selection is largely arbitrary. Most paths which cross through the center of the continent should provide results within a few hours of one another, however. For this analysis, a path was chosen which crosses the northern tip of Shinovar in the west and Dawn's Shadow in the East.

The Everstorm moves at a rate of 9.1 Rosharan days per cycle, which equates to an angular speed of 1.978 degrees per Rosharan hour. The colored map of Roshar released with Oathbringer includes lines of longitude (200 divisions) and latitude (100 divisions) for the continent. These "Rosharan degrees" can be converted to degrees for the purpose of calculating the position of locations relative to the path of the Everstorm. For simplicity, the map's central longitude, passing through the eastern corner of Kadrix and the eastern edge of the Purelake, is taken as the Prime Meridian. Based on other maps of Roshar, the latitude passing through the southern tip of Kadrix and just above Rall Elorim, is taken as the Equator. We use Narak as the point of origin along the great circle path, and determine the timing for other locations based on their angle parallel to the path from this origin. Their perpendicular distance from the path is not relevant to the calculation, though presumably the Everstorm fades notably in strength at some distance.

The provided lines of longitude are also important in determining the "time zone" of any given location. We find that mainland Roshar spans nearly 120 degrees of longitude at the most extreme points, putting the east coast about one third of a day ahead of the west coast. Because the Everstorm moves from west to east, it's slow pace is exaggerated by way it moves with the planet's rotation rather than counter to it. Unlike highstorms, which generally come and pass within a single Rosharan day, the Everstorm takes several days to cross the continent. Tracking the exact local time that it arrives is important. These calculations use a 20-Rosharan-hour clock. As the entire planet consists of 200 Rosharan degrees, every 10 Rosharan degrees of longitude corresponds to a 1-Rosharan-hour difference in local time. Rather than dividing the continent into discrete time zones, these calculations determine a unique local time (relative to the Prime Meridian) for every location.

The final step is to synchronize this model with the timing observed. The most precise data point we know of concerning this was provided by Kaladin, who stated that the Everstorm passed "around noon" on the day he arrived in Hearthstone. Thus we use at noon (local time) in Hearthstone as our basis for the rest of the timing. Observations of other Everstorm arrival times appear to match this observation by Kaladin within a reasonable margin of error.

For detailed calculations, see User:Jofwu's spreadsheet.

= Sample Calculation =

This section walks through the calculation for the Everstorm's first arrival at Urithiru.

Urithiru is located at 21.0 Rosharan degrees South and 4.0 Rosharan degrees East, or (-21.0, -4.0). We divide by 200 and multiply by 360 to convert to degrees: (-37.8, -7.2). Next we convert to Cartesian coordinates, taking the XY plane as the equatorial plane, +Z as the northern hemisphere, and Y=0 as the Prime Meridian. Urithiru's coordinates corresponds to a unit vector of: (0.78392, -0.09903, -0.61291).

The next step is to rotate to a coordinate system with the XY plane as the great circle path of the Everstorm. That plane is defined by the locations referenced above. In Rosharan degrees, these are northern Shinovar (-9, -25) and Dawn's Shadow (-13, 33). We rotate these coordinates such that Dawn's Shadow is located at (1,0,0). Applying the same rotation to Urithiru gives a unit vector of: (0.95433, -0.19377, -0.22738).

This is then converted back to a "longitude" (angle along the great circle, starting from Dawn's Shadow) and "latitude" (angle of separation perpendicular to the great circle), before one final rotation which sets Narak at zero degrees "longitude". Urithiru's final "position" (the "longitude", or angle along the great circle) is 308.9 degrees, indicating that the Everstorm travels 308.9 degrees around Roshar from Narak to Urithiru. It's final "distance" (the "latitude", or angle normal to the great circle) is -13.1 degrees, indicating that Urithiru is 13.1 degrees "below" the center of the Everstorm's path.

Calculations for the arrival of the first Everstorm at Hearthstone indicate that the storm was summoned at 12:11 UTC (local time at the Prime Meridian). At a rate of 9.1 days per cycle (or 1.978 degrees per hour), the Everstorm crosses the 308.9 degrees to Urithiru in 7.81 days. Thus, the Everstorm began at 12:11 UTC on and reached Urithru at 8:19 UTC on. Urithiru's longitude (4 Rosharan degrees West) places the local time at 0:20 behind UTC. This gives a local arrival time of 7:49 on.</description>

      <description>Detritus is a once-abandoned planet surrounded in a multi-layer artificial shell. It is home to the descendants of the crew of the Defiant, one of the last surviving human spaceships. Chased through space by the alliance of aliens opposed to human conquest, Spensa's great-grandmother guided the Defiant onto Detritus as her dying act. Since landing, the planet has become a prison for humans. The population of the Defiant and its fleet have been trapped on the planet for seventy five years. Most of the population is gathered in the caverns near the initial landing site of the fleet, though there are enclaves all over the planet.

Detritus's debris field has old guns that still are functional and will shoot down any large ship that gets too close, making it so that only small, maneuverable ships can get through. The shielding was known to interfere with communication, though it is unknown if this refers to Cytonics messages or normal radio signals.

The planet was inhabited by other humans before, though it wasn't called Detritus during that time. Later on, the planet was known about but avoided.

Detritus is smaller than Earth. It is a blue-grey color. The planet does not have any oceans.

The rats inhabiting the caverns are not native, and were there before the Defiants crashed on it.

According to M-Bot, the shipyards that can be found in Detritus's atmosphere were previously used to manufacture starships.</description>

She has dark hair and is seventeen.

Dia is a bully who often picks on Spensa. Dia makes a habit of trying to goad the other girl, often by taking jabs at Spensa's father, and can be quite vicious with her remarks. Spensa intensely dislikes Dia, to the point of wishing to punch her.

Dia is aware that the children of First Citizen's automatically pass the entrance exam to Flight School.

Dia joined the Administration Corp once she finished school, a job secured for her by her father.</description>

It is played on hoverbikes fitted with acclivity rings that are too small for ships and involves the use of a ball. Each bike can go three-D in short bursts, however, is only allowed a certain amount of airtime during the game. There is an organised sports program known as the Digball League, which is either made up of, or encompasses, a student league. Carrier is the only known position.

Hurl is one of the best Carriers in the student league.

Tickets are awarded to workers with exemplary merits.</description>

- Dorgo cautioning Spensa of the functions of Skyward Five before she took off in the Second Battle of Alta.

Dorgo is a member of the groudcrew at Alta Base. He is a kind person and well knowledgeable about the workings of the DDF's aircrafts.

He is familiar with the pilots of Alta Base, knowing Spensa by sight, and knowing detail about Callsign: Vigor's history in the DDF. He often works with Skyward Flight, and with Spensa's Poco in particular. He's part of the team responsible for dismantling Skyward Five, Arturo's ship, after it was severely damaged.

Dorgo has some level of authority, giving the go ahead to allow Spensa to take off in Arturo's damaged ship during the Second Battle of Alta, despite no official orders from Ironsides. Before she takes off, Dorgo hands Spensa the helmet with her callsign, indicating that someone in the ground crew had taken the time to find her specific helmet, despite the fact that she had been dismissed from the DDF.</description>

      <description>The Defiant League is the collection of cavern city-states which make up the human population of Detritus, the survivors of the Defiant fleet. They named themselves Defiants after the flagship of their old fleet. Not all humans that live on Detritus are part of the Defiant League, with some of the old clans continuing to rove the planet as nomads.

The Defiant League consists of a number of caverns including Igneous Cavern, Vici Cavern, Bountiful Cavern, and the Deep caverns. The cave network is known as the United Defiant Caverns.

Workers wear jumpsuits, with different colors denoting the profession.

Prior to the Battle of Alta, the humans lived in small clans that populated different parts of the planet as larger groups could be detected by the Krell. Each clan was made up of individuals that could trace their lineage back to a specific ship or crew from the Defiant's fleet. After finding Igneous, some of these clans began to create starfighters and Alta Base was constructed. The defeat of the Krell at the Battle of Alta allowed for the many groups of humans on Detritus to join together forming the Defiant League.</description>

      <description>"Defiance is not 'Defiant' to them unless it doesn’t actually defy anything."

- FM criticizing Ironsides and the DDF

Disputers are a movement on Detritus gaining some popularity in the lower caverns. The Defiant elite class it as a counterculture movement.</description>

      <description>"If it comes down to destroying Alta but saving Igneous, Igneous is more important. There’s a reason we rotate a third of our ships, pilots, and command staff into the deep caverns. The DDF can survive—maybe—if Alta is destroyed. But without the apparatus to make new ships, we’re done for. So if the admiral orders it, you shoot that bomb and make it detonate, even if doing so destroys Alta."

- Cobb on the importance of Igneous and the deep caverns to the survival of the DDF.

The deep caverns are a subset of the United Defiant Caverns that are below Alta Base on Detritus.</description>

      <description>Drama is a cadet in either Inkwell Flight or Firestorm Flight in the DDF. She is likely from Bountiful Caverns. It is unclear whether Drama is a callsign or this cadet's name.

There are only four people in her Flight in the time period just before graduation. She is used to a large amount of conversation occurring over her communication line during flights and may herself be a chatty person. She has a good-natured relationship with the three members remaining in her Flight before graduation.

Drama has dinner with with FM, Spensa, and the members of Inkwell and Firestorm Flight shortly after Arturo is pulled from Flight School. She claims to know Jorgen, however, believes he would not interact with the other members of his Flight unless giving orders or criticizing them. It is unclear whether she has developed this opinion based on generalization's of the Skyward flightleader or because of previous interactions with him.

She is unable to pronounce Arturo's callsign and is familiar with his outgoing personality. She characterizes Spensa as being a quiet person and believes, to some extent, that FM is similar, as she assumes that with Arturo's departure, Skyward Flight would not communicate much outside of necessary commands.</description>

      <description>"Their father had been too busy getting himself cut apart in foolish duels of honor, including the one where he'd taken a blow to the head. He’d never been right after that."

- Dalinar's recollections

Dalinar's father was an Alethi brightlord. He died at an unknown point prior to the War of Reckoning.

Very little is known about him. His branch of House Kholin was one of the poorer, and couldn't afford monasteries or practice guards. His place of residence is unspecified, but it wasn't Kholinar. In his youth, he participated in a war of some sort. His wife -- Dalinar and Gavilar's mother -- died when the two boys were still children. When Dalinar became old enough to learn swordfighting, his father hired Harth, a swordsman from two towns over, to teach him.

As a younger man, brightlord Kholin participated in numerous duels, with one ending in a severe head injury, leading to some sort of condition that left his two sons to raise themselves. Perhaps as a result of this, in his old age, he suffered from delusions where he thought he was back in the numerous battles of his youth. It's uncertain when he passed away, but it was likely within Adolin's lifetime.</description>

      <description>The cormax drones are a species or peoples known to the Superiority.

Next to nothing is known about them, other than that they're highly aggressive, but not as capable as humans, and that they do not produce many cytonics. The manner in which they're referred to -- "a cormax drone" -- suggests that drones may be a caste or a group within some greater cormax species, similar to some bug populations, and their aggression may be due to protecting other cormax; however, this is purely speculative.</description>

      <description>"Did you know that even then, with computers and libraries and all kinds of reminders, we found it easy to forget where we came from?"

- Becca Nightshade

Earth, sometimes called the Old Earth, is the home planet of humans in the Cytoverse.

During the early days of humanity's contact with aliens, Earth was ruled by a single institution called the United Governments, aided by the United Intelligence Bureau. The Phone Company, the telecom that served as the liaisons between humanity and aliens, was also headquartered there. Over time, however, the planet grew largely irrelevant. Even its location seems to have been forgotten, with some people incorrectly speculating that Detritus might be Earth's ruins. Nonetheless, both astrophysical data and numerous historical records of Old Earth remain within humanity's and Superiority's data banks.

By the time the Superiority became a major power, Earth appears to have vanished. Whether it simply means it can't be found on any star charts, or if it's somehow no longer where it should be, is unclear.</description>

      <description>"I suggest, that the ratio of the gears used in the lift machinery might be indicative of the nature of those who built it. It is the science of digitology, you see. You can judge much about a man by the width of his fingers."

- Elthebar

Digitology is a method of judging people based on the width of their fingers on Roshar. A stormwarden named Elthebar suggested that the gear ratio of the fabrial lifts of Urithiru could somehow be related to the fingers of the people who crafted them.</description>

      <description>"When the Curse of Kind followed you, you learned to take what happened as it happened."

- Axies' thoughts

The Curse of Kind is something that affects Axies the Collector; he specifically describes it as "following" him. Bad luck follows in the wake of those with Curse of Kind, affecting people who interact with someone with the curse and possibly those with the curse as well. This effect is tied to Fortune. As a result of the curse, Axies has learned to be more accepting of and adjust to events that happen to him. The curse may be related to the Siah Aimians or Aimia more broadly.</description>

By the reign of Emperor Ashravan, the celebration of Delbahad had stopped. While Shai was Forging a new soul for Ashravan, the Heritage Faction reinstituted the celebration of Delbahad hoping to sway public opinion in their favor. Shai thought this was foolish; if she failed to Forge a soul for Ashravan, the arbiters of the factions would select the new emperor, not the people.</description>

      <description>Dark One Book 1 is the first book in a series of graphic novel written by Brandon Sanderson and adapted into its format by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly, with artwork by Nathan Gooden and Kurt Michael Russell. The story takes places both on Earth and in an alternate world called Mirandus, with the two worlds influencing each other, even though only some in each are aware of the other. Though the protagonist, Paul Tanasin, is from Earth, there are prophecies of him in Mirandus -- prophecies claiming that he will be their destroyer, the Dark One.</description>

      <description>Exeltec is a biotech firm founded five years before the death of Panos Maheras. The company is originally owned by ten investors, with Nathan Haight, the largest investor, serving as CEO. Stephen Leeds later temporarily buys the company, before selling it to Yol Chay.

Soon after Exeltec's inception, the company released their primary product, a drug that helped patients with Parkinson's disease. A year later, however, a competitor developed a better drug and Exeltec lost most of its revenue. Despite years of funding, its next three products all failed on the market and the company made no economic progress. As Exeltec grew increasingly desperate, they gained a reputation for "moral ambiguity and espionage," and were subject to four separate investigations; by the time of Panos' death, three had been closed without conclusive findings and the fourth&mdash;for cutting corners in overseas manufacturing&mdash;was ongoing.

Increasingly desperate, Exeltec hires Zen Rigby to steal Panos' body, hoping it will lead to a new drug that will save the company. During his investigation into Panos' death, Stephen Leeds aggressively pursues the company and has Yol Chay manipulate it economically so that the value of its shares will plummet. This enables Wilson to buy sixty percent of the company's stock on behalf of Stephen, which allows Stephen to vote himself president of the company and order Zen Rigby to stand down. Stephen has no interest in running the company, however, and forced Yol to buy the company from him in return for helping with the Panos case.</description>

The only known instance of a Cognitive anomaly is in the Nalthian system. The scholars of Silverlight have a star chart that shows an anomaly within the orbital path of Nalthis. The map's representation of the anomaly resembles a roughly planet-sized gaseous cloud; it is unclear if this is a stylized depiction or if the anomaly actually exists in the Physical Realm.</description>

      <description>"And while I am your friend, please understand that our goals do not completely align. You must not trust yourself with me. If I have to watch this world crumble and burn to get what I need, I will do so. With tears, yes, but I would let it happen."

- Hoid to Dalinar

Hoid is a recurring character in the cosmere, as well as a legend rumored to have a thousand titles (most of which, he says, are not pleasant). He has appeared in almost every cosmere novel, short story, and novella which takes place in that universe. Note that his real name is likely not Hoid. In The Way of Kings, he mentions he stole the name from someone he should have loved, while giving Kaladin his flute and telling the story of the Wandersail. In section 2 of the 2nd Letter from Words of Radiance, the author of the letter (Frost) asks if Hoid is no longer hiding behind the name of his old master. The name "Hoid" is likely the name he is hiding behind.

Hoid was involved in the events taking place before any of the cosmere's published books begin, and is the second oldest character seen so far. He was originally human, but has changed enough that when asked, Brandon only says "It's complicated." Hoid is not a Shard, nor is he a Herald, but something else entirely. He is very skilled with disguises, and the overtness of his involvement varies from book to book. In some, he is named outright and makes references to other events and places in the cosmere, while in others he is seen only deep in disguise, almost unrecognizable. Brandon has confirmed that all of these appearances are the same individual, but that he worldhops between planets. Hoid's motives are unknown, and most of his actions occur behind the scenes. He is searching for something unknown.

His particular style of storytelling in which he manipulates sand or smoke to illustrate his stories, as in Warbreaker and The Way of Kings, does not originate from White Sand, but from another unpublished story, The Liar of Partinel. In Warbreaker, Siri asked Hoid where he learned his style of story telling. Hoid answered, "I learned it many, many years ago from a man who didn't know who he was, Your Majesty. It was a distant place where two lands meet and gods have died. But that is unimportant." His origin will be revealed in the Dragonsteel series, and so it is commonly believed Hoid is from Yolen, the world of Dragonsteel and Liar. He also has a "home base" somewhere in the Cognitive Realm.

Hoid is neither the author of the Ars Arcanum, nor of the back-of-book blurb for Words of Radiance. He occasionally will show up somewhere, stand around for a while, realize there isn't a novel-worthy plot going on, and leave.</description>

      <description>Hrathen was a high priest of Shu-Dereth, and an accomplished statesman on Sel. He was forty-two years old when he entered Arelon.

For most of his life, he was a devout follower of the Derethi religion, although his devotion was more a product of logic than of faith.

Hrathen was a graduate of Ghajan Monastery, and rose quickly in the ranks of the priesthood. His talent for public speaking made him an invaluable tool of Wyrn Wulfden the Fourth in his attempt to conquer the world through the spread of the Derethi religion. Hrathen's particular talent lay in destroying the kingdoms of those who did not convert, and he had a hand in both the destruction of the Duladel Republic, and the simultaneous invasion of Arelon and Teod. During the invasion of Teod, he came to a full awareness of Wyrn's corruption of Shu-Dereth, and was instrumental in stopping the complete destruction of both kingdoms. Unfortunately, his efforts to save Princess Sarene resulted in his death at the hands of Dilaf and Fjon. For his efforts, he was buried with the rest of the heroes of the battle just outside of Elantris.</description>

      <description>"The treaty," Vivenna said. "It protects our people." "Austre protects our people."

- Fafen and Vivenna discussing Siri's departure from Idris.

Fafen was a princess of Idris, the third child of King Dedelin, with elder siblings being Vivenna, Ridger, and her younger sister being Siri. Of the three sisters, Fafen was the middle sister in almost every way. She was midway in height between Vivenna and Siri, and less proper than Vivenna, though not as careless as Siri.

Fafen was a monk of Austrism, and so she wore white robes and was required have her hair completely sheared off. Her duty, as with all monks, is to grow food for the needy, do tasks around the city, and provide for those who could not provide for themselves. Fafen made the choice to become a monk before her tenth birthday, and has devoted herself to this task ever since. It was tradition that noble or rich families were obligated to send a child to the monasteries. Siri was happy that Fafen was the monk in the family and not her, and said she would have gone crazy living as a monk. Fafen also had a curvy figure, which attracted men around Bevalis, but her status as a monk kept suitors at bay, as they would have to become monks if they wished to marry her.

Fafen had taken lessons in court life and politics in case Vivenna died before marrying the God King of Hallandren. When Siri was sent to Hallandren instead of Vivenna, Fafen believed that Vivenna would inherit the throne of Idris instead of Ridger.

Fafen had a tendency to avoid thinking things through unless she was confronted with them directly, which meant that people often had to engage her with blunt comments to get through to her.</description>

The Heralds are servants of the Almighty worshipped across the whole of Roshar. There are ten of them, with each associated with one of the Ten Essences and one of the ten orders of the Knights Radiant. They are known by different names in different cultures -- in Azir, they are known as the Kadasixes, and in Vorin countries, the suffix "'Elin" is often appended to their names, presumably as a honorific.</description>

The magical properties of modern fabrials can usually be activated by anyone who knows how to use them. A person who creates or designs fabrials is called an artifabrian. The term "fabrial" is often used colloquially to refer to the entire device. Artifabrians, however, call that a "machine", and use the word fabrial to refer specifically to a gem with a captured spren.</description>

The city's natural rock formations make it much more defensible than the larger western city Tremredare. It contains one of the Lord Ruler's storage caches.

After the Collapse, Ashweather Cett makes the city his capital. He takes all of the known allomancers with him when he marches against Luthadel, taking mostly from houses Gardre and Conrad. During the Siege of Luthadel the Obligator Aradan Yomen rises to power. He reimposes the social structures of the Final Empire, throwing balls for the nobility.

The city is besieged by Elend Venture for the cache. The siege ultimately results in an alliance between Venture and Yomen.</description>

They progress across the continent, though they weaken gradually as they cross, and are mostly broken by the mountains east of Shinovar. This weakness is caused by a combination of being over land instead of water, and infusing spheres with Stormlight.</description>

      <description>The Five Scholars are a group of Returned who study Awakening and BioChroma. Their research leads to the ability to create Lifeless with only one Breath as well as the formulation of the Ichor-alcohol necessary to ensure their continued and efficient operation. At least some of the scholars are worldhoppers.

One of the Five Scholars discovered a Command for creating Lifeless with one Breath. Before this, Lifeless required fifty Breaths to create, and so were expensive to make. Yesteel discovered Ichor-alcohol, which allowed a Lifeless to continue functioning for a much longer period of time without mantainence. The ability to create Lifeless so cheaply which would last a long time was one of the reasons for the Manywar. Not to be outdone, Shashara discovered how to Awaken steel with a thousand Breaths, and with Vasher's help created Nightblood. When the Manywar started, the Five Scholars split among the various factions, with lovers Vasher and Shashara on the side of Hallandren, then know as Hanald. This caused the different sides of the Manywar to have access to different Awakening knowledge and techniques. Vasher created powerful Lifeless from Awakened bones incased in stone, and used them to seize power away from the royal family, who fled to the mountains. Denth tried to keep the peace between the various factions and stop the Manywar, but eventually joined his sister, Shashara, and Vasher. Shashara used Nightblood in the Battle of Twilight Falls, and wanted to reveal the secret to creating more Awakened swords. Vasher was shocked by the destruction caused by one Awakened sword, and did not want others to be made. He and Shashara fought, and Vasher eventually killed Shashara with Nightblood. Denth was furious, and wants Vasher to pay for killing his sister. Vasher ended the Manywar by calling back his Lifeless. Arsteel attempted to reconcile them, only for Vasher to kill him due to a misunderstanding. Vasher eventually kills Denth as well.</description>

Strict and militaristic, Fjorden is the dominant country of the continent. About three hundred years ago, their leader, the Wyrn, converted to the Derethi religion, and within a generation all of Fjorden had done likewise. Now, instead of sending troops across the continent, Fjorden sends priests, and it's said that much of Fjorden's vast power comes from conversions obtained — or forced — by them.</description>

      <description>"Requires? Vin thought. She already didn't like that tone, and she had little desire to meet with Elend's former betrothed. But House Elariel was one of the most powerful Great Houses--she was probably not someone to dismiss offhandedly."

- Vin, thinking of Shan Elariel

House Elariel is a Noble Great House of the Final Empire on Scadrial.. At the beginning of the Mistborn series it is the third most powerful Great House.

Members include Shan Elariel, a Mistborn from Luthadel. Shan was once engaged to Elend Venture. House Elariel also had the services of at least one other Mistborn, who may or may not have been a member of the family.

One of the balls that Vin went to in her time infiltrating the upper class was held at Keep Elariel.

Elariel seems to be a house well accustomed to intrigue. Its ballroom, full of secret alcoves and muted lighting, appears well suited for discussing secret alliances and schemes while at balls. Once Elend discovers that Shan Elariel is a Mistborn, he suspects that House Elariel's intention was to have him killed as soon as an Elariel grandson was born. This plot, if true, is an example of a strategy a House like Elariel might use when confronted with a dominant, apparently unassailable, force like Venture, and demonstrates a tendency towards patience and subterfuge. House Elariel has possibly done this sort of thing before. Certain houses are mentioned as being "cousins" of House Elariel (including Patresen, Habren, and Seeris). This could indicate that Elariel was once part of a larger family that split apart, that Elariel often recruits allies through marriage, or some combination of the two.

On the night the Lord Ruler was killed, House Elariel was the second most powerful house in the city. Because Straff Venture fled the city, and Elend defected to the rebellion, when Elariel was defeated by the skaa rebellion, it arguably had become the most powerful remaining Great House, a notable achievement.

After the Catacendre the surviving members of House Elariel ended up "all over" the Elendel Basin.

Keep Elariel is smaller than Keep Venture, but it has a separate party ballroom, which is the only part of the Keep that Vin observes. The ballroom building is squat, and is one of several lower wings extending from the main keep. Guests are required to climb steps in order to enter the ballroom. The ballroom is only a single story high, and all of the stained glass windows are in the ceiling. The circular rose-window skylights shine from above, lit by small lime-lights on the roof. Each table is set with candles, and despite the light from above, there is a reserved darkness around the room. To Vin, it seems private, despite the numerous people attending the ball. The room is obviously designed to accommodate parties. A sunken dancing floor lies at the center of the ballroom, where the lighting is better. There are two tiers of tables circling the dance floor: the first tier is only a few feet above, while the other is farther back and about twice as high. The deep crystalline colors from above project patterns across tables and people, creating an impressive atmosphere, yet making it difficult to distinguish faces.</description>

      <description>"Some scholars say that the Manywar was fought over these ﬂower petals, that the kingdoms of Kuth and Huth were destroyed by little drips of color."

- Hoid to Lightsong and Siri.

Huth is a nation-state on Nalthis. Like Kuth, Huth lies beyond the mountains of Idris.

Along with Kuth, Huth was the main rival to Vasher's Hanald in the Manywar, and eventually fell by the conflict's end. It is unclear if Kuth and Huth were part of the Pahn Unity.

Three hundred years after the Manywar, a tyrant is trying to restore both Huth and Kuth, with Yesteel's help.</description>

It is among the less powerful houses during the Final Empire. A member of the house, Ferson Penrod, elects to remain in Luthadel after the death of the Lord Ruler, becoming one of the most influential noblemen in the government of the Central Dominance under King Elend Venture, and eventually succeeding him to that title. After succumbing to the influence of Ruin Ferson kills himself, presumably the end of his house.</description>

- Kaladin's thoughts on the chasm.

Honor Chasm is a chasm in the Shattered Plains on Roshar. It begins narrow but becomes wider and deeper as it runs east. The edge of the chasm is down an incline. Six ladders are set up to allow bridgemen to go down into the chasms.

It is located a short distance from Sadeas's warcamp.

It is the only place that Sadeas' bridge crews are allowed to visit unsupervised. The bridgemen use it to commit suicide. Gaz prefers that the bridgemen leave their sandals and vest behind if they choose to go to the Honor Chasm so he will not have to send someone down to fetch the clothing.</description>

      <description>House Tekiel is one of the great noble houses on Scadrial. House Tekiel was ranked fourth in power, just after House Elariel.

In the Final Empire, House Tekiel has a political rivalry with House Izenry. They have canal routes through the eastern plains. Due to the rivalries and suspicions sowed by Kelsier, House Tekiel loses a lot of business and begins going into debt. This destroys their reputation and their finances start to crumble. In a last attempt to save face, they attempt to withdraw from Luthadel. The evening before their withdrawal, many members are assassinated and those remaining are supposedly attacked by bandits on the canal routes. In actuality, it is the work of House Hasting.

Post-Catacendre, House Tekiel is responsible for the building of Tekiel Tower in Elendel. They are the subject of insurance fraud by the Set. House Tekiel's connection to the Ascendant Warrior is known, and they have attempted to capitalise on that fact.

Members include Tevidian Tekiel (Lord Prelan of the Steel Ministry) and his illegitimate children: Vin, her (unnamed) sister, and young noblemen by the names of Salmen and Kale Tekiel.</description>

      <description>High Imperial, known before the Final Ascension of Harmony as Eastern Street Slang, is a dialect on Scadrial used by Spook. After the ascension of Harmony, High Imperial turned into a scholarly, formal language that was rarely used outside of important legal documents.

"One thing about High Imperial, or Eastern Street Slang, is that it was devised by those who spoke it in order to be intentionally obtuse. So it was hard for people to understand. And so there are a lot of nonsense words thrown in the middle. But, it's also got reversed grammar. 'Wasing the wanting of doing the thing' is 'I wanted to do that.' But you can also throw random words in there. As long as those parts are in there, it'll make sense to those they're speaking to. 'I wanted to do this. Wasing the wanting of doing the thing.' You're putting everything into a gerund. You're starting with the verb and the tense. And you're turning everything into ridiculously bad gerunds. That's it in brief."

Harmony is the name taken by Sazed after the Final Ascension and his acquisition of the Shards Ruin and Preservation. With the opposing forces of Preservation and Ruin both invested within him, balance and Harmony is achieved. It is unknown whether he took the name Harmony himself, or if it was later attributed to him by the followers of the Path. Three hundred years post-Catacendre the name is in widespread use by the inhabitants of the Elendel Basin and the surrounding Roughs.</description>

      <description>House Cett is a noble house on Scadrial. Despite its nobility, House Cett is unable to produce any Mistborns, and only a few Mistings. Before the death of the Lord Ruler, House Cett had very little power. After the death of the Lord Ruler, they attempt to siege Luthadel under Lord (temporarily king) Ashweather Cett. Although they are classified as noble, House Cett has a long history of skaa interbreeding, and as a result Allrianne is the only Cett Allomancer in centuries. During the Siege of Luthadel, Cett, his family and his servants take up residence in Keep Hasting. Their small army of 200 soldiers and hazekillers is attacked and destroyed one night by Vin and Zane, in an attempt to try to confirm Vin's suspicion that Ashweather is secretly a Mistborn.

Members include Ashweather, his children Allrianne and Gneorndin, and their descendants, Lady Aving and Lord Westweather.</description>

      <description>A Half-shard is a type of augmenter fabrial developed by Veden Artifabrians late during the War of Reckoning.

They are the only known objects able to block a Shardblade apart from Shardplate, other Shardblades, metalminds and aluminium. Despite not granting any of the other benefits of Shardplate, such as enhanced strength and agility, they represent a significant breakthrough in fabrial science. Their bulky size and shape often leads to their users being hampered in ways Shardbearers are not. While inspired by Shardplate, half-shards work according to a different design principle.

Their design consists of a diamond-shaped metal plate with an infused gem attached to its back to increase its durability.

Half-shards were used by King Hanavanar of Jah Keved in his failed attempt to kill Szeth.

When Dalinar travels to Azimir, Navani sends along detailed schematics of the new half-shards provided by Taravangian in an effort to generate good will with the Vizier's.</description>

      <description>The Highprince of War is a title bestowed by the Alethi king to one of the highprinces. The Highprince of War has authority over all war-related activities.

Dalinar Kholin requested the title be given to him so he could unite the Alethi highprinces. King Elhokar replied that he would do this if Dalinar could provide him with proof that the other highprinces would be willing to work together. Dalinar proceeded to approach each highprince individually and was turned down each time for various reasons until he successfully managed to convince Highprince Torol Sadeas to attempt bridge runs with him.

Only after Dalinar survived Sadeas's betrayal at the Battle of the Tower did he force Elhokar to name him the Highprince of War.

Dalinar used his new authority to change the distribution of gemhearts on the Shattered Plains so that the war would no longer consist of the highprinces competing for the gemhearts. Instead, he assigned pairs of highprinces to go on each run, which he hoped would help teach them to work together, and claimed the gemhearts as property of the king, to be distributed back to the highprinces as rewards for their obedience and effectiveness in battle. Along with this change in how the highprinces would be acquiring gemhearts, Dalinar also used his position to encourage the other highprinces to follow the Alethi Codes of War, though he stopped short of seizing their assets for failure to do so.

Following the creation of the Everstorm and their arrival at Urithiru, Dalinar is forced to take full control of the individual armies of all highprinces, in an effort to fully unify all of the Alethi, and in order to continue training and squash additional squabbles.</description>

They taught the believers of Austre to be patient, humble, sacrificing, selfless, and understanding and to not be ostentatious, selfish or place themselves above others.

To set an example in following the Five Visions, every noble or rich family was obligated by tradition to provide one person to the monasteries.</description>

      <description>The Expanse of the Densities is the Rosharan term for the Selish subastral of the Cognitive Realm. After Splintering Devotion and Dominion, Odium pushed their Investiture into the Cognitive Realm. Due to the contained nature of the space, that Investiture is in an incredibly dangerous and highly pressurized state, similar to plasma. This Investiture fills the region as a deadly storm known as the Dor and is the reason Rosharans call the region the Expanse of the Densities. It strains Hoid's resources to safely travel there, but he has done it on occasion.

It can be accessed from Devotion's Perpendicularity near Elantris, the other Perpendicularity on Sel, or by traveling there from another region of the Cognitive Realm; it is adjacent to to the Nexus of Truth on the Rosharan map of Shadesmar.</description>

      <description>The Expanse of the Vapors is a location in Shadesmar. It is bordered by the Sea of Lost Lights and the Nexus of Imagination.

The Expanse of the Vapors leads to Scadrial.

In Mistborn: Secret History, Kelsier goes to the Cognitive Realm on Scadrial, and describes everything that doesn't have Investiture to be made of 'thick, shifting mists' that coalesced in the same shape as everything in the Physical Realm. This is likely where the Expanse of the Vapors gets its name. As part of the Scadrian subastral, mist obscures everything and metals glow with a brilliant light. The counterpart to bodies of water is smoky stone where mysterious plants grow and the counterpart to solid earth is a misty, vaporous substance.</description>

He was supposed to assume the role as the head of House Ladrian when his father faked his own death, but he caught a disease and died. Edwarn's plans were already in action, so he was forced to name Wax his successor as the new head of the house and hope that Wax would be useful.

Hinston's death was used as an excuse for why Edwarn, his wife, and Telsin were going for a carriage ride in the Outer Estates. It was supposedly going to be a trip to take their minds off of their grief.

He was born when Wax was eighteen. Before this Edwarn had already started training Wax & Telsin to be the heir.</description>

      <description>Hashal is a lighteyed woman in Sadeas warcamp on the Shattered Plains.

She is married to Brightlord Matal and has dark hair, pale blue eyes, and a Kholinar accent.

She buys Kaladin and the rest of Tvlakv's slaves from him, taking them to Lamaril and Gaz and saying that "the tall one is to be given special treatment". Later, after the execution of Lamaril, her husband Matal becomes commander of the Sadeas bridgecrews.

She attempts to put stress on Bridge Four by assigning them to daily chasm duty, and eventually increases the quota when this does not work quickly enough in order to add more stress as well as eventually making them take part in every bridge run. She even makes them run and scavenge on the same day. Even though she knows that Bridge Four is severely undermanned, she only assigns them one new member; the parshman Shen, who she hoped would lead to the death of all the men of Bridge Four.

The men of Bridge Four believe that she has been ordered to treat them so harshly by Torol Sadeas so that he may rid himself of Kaladin, who attracts a large amount of attention for surviving outside in a Highstorm.

After Gaz deserts his post, she personally takes the role of giving Kaladin and the other bridgeleaders their schedule in the morning. Hashal also pointedly ignores any questions concerning where the sergeant had gone to.

Hashal later takes credit for Kaladin's tactic and drops Bridge Four's quota for chasm duty in order to give them a chance to get more carapace. She ignored any questions as to where she had gotten Parshendi carapace in the first place, but Kaladin believes she is worried about what he will do next, as well as his growing reputation.</description>

      <description>Forgery is a manifestation of Investiture on Sel that is powered by the Dor.

Much like AonDor, Dakhor, and the other known magical systems used elsewhere on Sel, Forgery involves shaping a specific form in order to evoke some sort of extra-normal event. There are many types of Forgery that are explored in The Emperor's Soul, but all seem to involve the carving of a sort of stamp, the application of ink to the stamp, and then applying a mark onto the desired object or person.

One appears to need an extraordinary amount of knowledge of the background and composition of the object or person being Forged in order to make a stamp affect a target for an extended period of time. Therefore, Forgers probably need to be scholars and researchers as well as talented artisans.

Forgery is a cousin system to Bloodsealing, which shares some similarities.</description>

      <description>Han ShuXen is a painter from the Rose Empire on Sel. His paintings are well-known and extremely valuable in the Empire.

He painted the masterpiece Lily of the Spring Pond for a woman he loved. On her death, her children gave the painting to the Rose Empire; it is owned by the arbiter Frava. However, ShuXen felt that the painting should not outlive its intended recipient and did not want it used to glorify the Rose Empire. He hired the Forger Wan ShaiLu, whom he had tutored in her youth, to destroy it and replace it with a copy. Shai felt that she owed a debt to her former mentor and agreed to the plan.

ShuXen assists Shai in making a masterful copy of Lily of the Spring Pond, providing his studies for the original painting and advice on the brushwork. Shai also makes a second copy of passable quality that she uses as a decoy. Shai is able to execute the plan and burns the original painting, replacing it with the master forgery.

In his old age he has gone blind and can barely move.</description>

"Death.""

- Hanavanar and Szeth

Hanavanar is the king of Jah Keved. He is assassinated by Szeth on the orders of King Taravangian of Kharbranth in order to cause political instability.

Hanavanar is on good enough terms with the rulers of Alethkar that Balat believes that discovery of Shallan's theft of Jasnah's Soulcaster would cause Hanavanar to turn House Davar over to the Alethi for execution. However, he and most other Vedens hold a personal grudge against Dalinar Kholin.</description>

      <description>Geant is a nation located on the continent of Opelon (also known as Sycla) on Sel. During the Late Era, it is under the domain of the Fjordell Empire.

Geant lies at the eastern edge of the Fjordell Empire. It borders Svorden to the north, Fjorden to the northwest, Hraggen to the west, and Hrovell to the southwest. The eastern side of the country is coastal, and unclaimed desert lies to its south. A large river defines most of its northern and western border, and a second river crosses the southern part of the country. Based on available maps, the largest city and presumed capital appears to be Velf, which lies on the northern river border with Svorden.

Since Geant is part of the Fjordell Empire, the official religion is Shu-Dereth. Unlike Svorden, Geant has not maintained a national identity; it no longer has its own language and the residents speak Fjordell.</description>

      <description>Hraggen is a nation under the dominion of the Fjordell Empire on the continent of Opelon during the Late Era. The Hraggish has been under Fjorden's control for a long period of time, possibly because they were just to the southeast of Fjorden. Hraggen is a relatively small nation, adjacent to Jaador, Hrovell, and Geant. Many of their words are in Fjordish, so it's likely that their ethnicity is Fjordell.

One city in Hraggen is Gmordsom, perhaps its capital.</description>

      <description>Hrovell is a nation under the domain of the Fjordell Empire located on the continent of Opelon on Sel during the Late Era. It is located in the rural southeast of the Fjordell Empire, so they have very little knowledge of what is happening in the world outside their nation. They speak a dialect of Derethi that has evolved so much that many Fjordell have difficulty understanding them.

Like all the nations in the Fjordell Empire, Hrovell had Shu-Dereth as their state religion. However, due to the nation's isolation, some places do not see a Derethi priest for months, many other religions were still practiced in secret, such as the Jeskeri Mysteries. Priests of Shu-Dereth considered their souls to be in great danger.

Hrovell had a standing army which was at the Wyrn's disposal.

The Hroven were an oppressed people who lived in fear, likely of the Fjordell Empire.</description>

      <description>Graspers are small creatures native to the Shattered Plains on Roshar.

Graspers are tentacled lairs that live in the bottom of small holes in the rock. They prey on cremlings snatching those nearby and pulling them into their lairs. This appears to be especially common after highstorms, as the cremlings drink water out of pools that form in the same holes that serve as lairs to graspers.</description>

They attempted to assassinate Emperor Ashravan, however only succeeded in killing his wife. Ashravan was left in a vegetative state, leading the Heritage Faction to coerce the Forger Wan ShaiLu into Forging him a new soul. It is likely the Glory Faction felt they would be able to elevate one of their members to the position of emperor if Ashravan was killed.

During the mourning period for the Emperor's wife, which was the excuse given for Ashravan's seclusion; the Glory Faction spreads rumors that Ashravan was killed believing that the Heritage Faction was only stalling for time. When the Essence Mark created for Ashravan is successful, he is able to reveal himself to the Factions. This leads to a weakening of the Glory Faction’s power since they had gambled on him not returning.</description>

Harl is a thick-shouldered darkeyed man from Hearthstone on Roshar.

In 1166, Harl's daughter Miasal fell a long ways and was seriously injured. Kaladin happened to be walking by, and did his best to treat her wounds. Harl was beside himself with fear, and initially tried to prevent Kaladin from helping Miasal. Several other men dragged Harl away so Kaladin could work. When he realized that Miasal had died he began shouting, shoving Kaladin aside and clutching his daughter's body. Harl wept holding his daughter's body for a long while.

At some point afterwards, Harl's wife also died from the scarfever.

In 1168, with both his wife and daughter dead, Harl voluntarily enlisted in Highmarshal Meridas Amaram's army along with Tien and Kaladin.</description>

      <description>Gavashaw was a criminal in Bornwater on Roshar.

He was set up as a rival to Makkek by the local lord in Kneespike, and was given a large mansion in the east of Bornwater. Szeth was sent by Makkek to assassinate him, but when Szeth infiltrated the mansion he found Gavashaw's head on a table in the bedroom. He was then confronted by a masked member of the Diagram who revealed that they had killed both Gavashaw and Makkek and that his master (Taravangian) now controlled Szeth's Oathstone.</description>

      <description>Fu Abra is a Purelaker village on Roshar. It is located somewhere on the Purelake and is the only village miles. A rare fish, known as a kolgril, can be found near the village.

The buildings are built on stilts, however, they are only partially raised, with several inches of water being found covering inside flooring. They have domed roofs, which make them resemble rockbuds.

Maib's house is located near the center of the village. It is where Ishikk met, more than once, with Grump, Blunt, and Thinker in their search for Hoid. Ishikk claims that Hoid hasn't been around.</description>

Holy grottos were significant places in the Purelaker religion that worshiped Nu Ralik. They were the only places where Purelakers dared to speak of their true faith to Nu Ralik rather than their pretended faith to Vun Makak, Nu Ralik's jealous younger brother. It is unknown where these holy grottos are located and what makes them believed to be safe from Vun Makak's observation.</description>

He guards Shai while she is crafting Ashravan's Essence Mark.

He has two young children, and is having an affair with a fellow guard. He secretly wishes that he was carpenter, like his father. He also likes to act less intelligent than he really is, in order to win card games.

Shai forges a letter from the Bloodsealer they call weedfingers to trick Hurli. She makes Hurli believe that the Bloodsealer is collecting nails, hair, and personal items belonging to him and the other guards in order to take control of their bodies and kidnap someone. Hurli and Yil assault the Bloodsealer, which results in him drinking too much and arriving too late to renew the stamp imprisoning Shai.

Shai believed that Hurli and her other guards would be reassigned to a backwater guard post after she finished her work, possibly guarding passes to the Teo Peninsula.</description>

      <description>Fellise was a small, suburban town in the Central Dominance, relatively close to Luthadel. It was a prosperous city with a reputation for being less crowded, cleaner, and less strict in enforcing the imperial laws than the capital. The nobility kept lavish villas and manors rather than the fortified keeps of Luthadel, and built them in a well-maintained and tidy part of the city. Some of the cobblestone streets are lined with aspen trees as the bark tends to resist ash stains. Vin notes though that the slums are much the same as they are in other cities.

Vin stayed in the town posing as a young member of House Renoux, a minor house supposedly interested in making alliances in the city nearby. Previously, she had worked in the city while travelling with her brother Reen before moving to Luthadel. She also trained as a Mistborn here under Kelsier.</description>

Garthwood is a city in the Final Empire on Scadrial. It is in the Southern Dominance, southeast of Vetitan.

Three months before koloss attacked Vetitan, koloss attacked Garthwood. Garthwood was larger than Vetitan--which meant that it had many more than Vetitan's seven thousand residents--but less than a hundred survivors eventually made it to Vetitan.</description>

He was a Rithmatic student at Armedius, but was expelled from the academy 30 years before. Thirty years later, he became a suspect in the investigation into the Scribbler and was arrested by Inspector Harding, because of the same reason he had been expelled from Armedius Academy: he could not control his chalklings. It was eventually proven that he was innocent.

He helped Joel escape from the Scribbler's wild chalkling attack.</description>

      <description>Grondkest is a philosopher known in Sycla on Sel.

Dilaf cites Grondkest during one of his Derethi sermons, when he ties Diren to a post and claims that fallen Elantrians are Svrakiss.

"Behold the enemy! Look, see! He does not bleed! No blood runs through his veins, and no heart beats in his chest. Did not the philosopher Grondkest say that you can judge the equality of all men by their common unity of blood? But what of one who has no blood? What shall we call him?"

      <description>""What the dusts is a Forgotten!" Joel said.

"A creature of Nebrask," Fitch said. "They lead the wild chalklings.""

- Discussion between Joel Saxon and Professor Fitch

The Forgotten lead the wild chalklings from the Tower of Nebrask. Unlike chalklings, which are made of chalk, the Forgotten appear to be made of charcoal and look like shadows. They however can still be destroyed by acid. They have the ability to bind with a person and grant Rithmatic powers much like a Shadowblaze, though this ability was unknown to humans until a Forgotten bound itself to Inspector Harding.

The Rithmatists it consumed are turned into wild chalklings, which can be used to attack and consume more people. This type of chalking can reform after being dissolved by acid.</description>

      <description>"You have two options, FhorKood. Either relinquish those bones, or I'll digest your body and kill you, as I did OreSeur."

- TenSoon to FhorKood.

FhorKood is a kandra of the Fifth Generation. His True Body is made of granite.

When KanPaar and the Second Generation take the First Generation captive in a coup, FhorKood and some other members of the Fifth Generation support the Seconds. FhorKood may be one of the Fifths that gag Haddek.

TenSoon, in his wolfhound body, breaks into the kandra Homeland, and with the help of MeLaan and other kandra revolutionaries, frees Sazed, who has been imprisoned in the Seconds' coup. However, TenSoon is seen entering the Homeland, and soon FhorKood and other Fifths come to subdue them. FhorKood and the Fifths do not expect Sazed's Feruchemy, and by tapping iron, Sazed is able to break the Fifths' bones, incapacitating them.

FhorKood has contempt for the Third Generation. When TenSoon demands to know what FhorKood had done, FhorKood simply responds with, "Dirty Third." TenSoon finds it amusing that KanPaar has branded him a Contract-breaker, but then FhorKood and the Seconds overthrow the First Generation.

TenSoon then threatens FhorKood and asks him to hand over his bones. FhorKood is terrified of TenSoon and relinquishes his bones, which allows TenSoon to impersonate him and tell the Second Generation that the traitor, TenSoon, has been captured. This buys time so that the rescued First Generation can reform their bodies.</description>

They are typically symmetrical and can be rendered with varying degrees of stylization. Two glyphs may be combined into a glyphpair, forming a word distinct from the constituent glyphs. Glyphs and glyphpairs are often designed as pictographs so that literacy is not required for comprehension. The writing system is not structured to facilitate the composition of sentences or more complex communication.</description>

He was one of Prince Eton's highest-ranking generals. He is burly and wears silver armor. He participates in a trial of Raoden and is tasked with beheading him. However, Eton had instituted a custom wherein the executor closed his eyes while delivering the killing blow, with a miss indicating that the accused was innocent all along. Gatrii does not strike Raoden, and Hrathen believes that he missed intentionally.</description>

      <description>"Names didn't mean a whole lot in the Forests. Or maybe they meant everything. The right ones, that was."

- Daggon on the Forests of Hell

The Forests of Hell are forests on a Shardworld known as Threnody.

The Forests of Hell are inhabited by shades, dangerous spirits capable of turning people into a new shade with a single touch. In order to protect themselves, humans developed the Simple Rules that were believed to help a person avoid the shades. Traveling in the forests, especially at night, is extremely dangerous.

The people who live in the Forests often build forts to live within, to protect themselves from the shades. Unfortunately, most of the fortfolk who left the forts, such as merchants, did not have the skills necessary to survive for long in the Forests. Those who live in the forts dressed differently than those without, wearing clothing such as tall hats with a wide brim, or long black coats with lace at the front. The fortfolk impose taxes on the people who live in the forests, but people often avoid those taxes by fleeing into the Forests. Fortfolk post bounties for these criminals, which bounty hunters, such as the White Fox, hunt down in exchange for measures of silver.

Waystops were built as well, neutral places in the forests, such as Silence's waystop. These waystops serve as safe zones for travelers in the Forests. There are also some homesteads that have been established.

Fugitives from justice often flee to the Forests, often going by aliases. Those who survive in the Forests are invariably tough and self-reliant. The weak or foolish don't survive longer than a few weeks.</description>

      <description>The Fallen World is a place on Threnody.

Threnody is known to have two continents, the larger of which was lost to the Evil under unknown circumstances. The term "Fallen World" may refer to this lost continent. The Homeland—the origin of the ancestors of Silence Montane and possibly the other Forescouts—is also mentioned as a place lost to the Evil; Homeland may be a synonym for Fallen World or it could be a specific part of that continent.

If the Fallen World does refer to the continent lost to the Evil, it is dangerous to visit. Expeditions in the Physical Realm have disappeared, and it is also holds peril in the Cognitive Realm.

Daggon claimed that the White Fox had been to the Fallen World, although his stories were often apocryphal.</description>

When Andrew Nalizar began lecturing the other professors at the dinner after he challenged Professor Fitch and received his tenure, Professor Haberstock tried to convince Nalizar that his point had been made and that he didn't need to upset things further. Later that night, he noticed Joel Saxon standing near the professors' dinner table, and warned Nalizar that Joel often tried to sneak into Rithmatics classes.

He doesn't allow non-Rithmatics students into his classes. As a result, Melody Muns was forced to deliver a note to him on at least one occasion.</description>

Fabrisan discovered a problem that was considered to be either incredibly difficult or impossible to solve. This problem was termed Fabrisan's Conundrum. For some reason, a solution to Fabrisan's Conundrum had the potential to help the world. On one of King Taravangian's most intelligent days, he solved Fabrisan's Conundrum. It seems that he did not share his solution, but likely will do so if Roshar survives the True Desolation.</description>

      <description>Gabrathin is a scholar on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

Nothing of Gabrathin's works is known, but they likely had to do with logic or the related arts. He was a prolific writer.

In 1173, Princess Jasnah Kholin, upon interviewing Brightness Shallan Davar to be her ward, wanted Shallan to have already read Gabrathin's works, but Shallan knew nothing of Gabrathin. Shallan later went to Artmyrn's bookstore and requested a book by Gabrathin.</description>

      <description>Guvlow is a scholar on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

Guvlow wrote a book called Incarnate. The book contained a quote from "The Poem of the Seventh Morning", an ancient poem that had otherwise been lost. During Jasnah Kholin's research regarding the Voidbringers, she studied Incarnate, which was generally thought to be reliable by scholars. The quote that was purportedly copied from a fragment of "The Poem of the Seventh Morning" was from a Radiant Stoneward named Talatin and addressed the difficulty in fighting Voidbringers.</description>

      <description>The Heraldic Forces were a believed to be the army of the Heralds that fought the Voidbringers for the Tranquiline Halls in what was called the War for Heaven.

The ardents taught that once the deceased had been burned after death, those who fulfilled their Callings best, who had chosen the best professions and worked hardest at them, would rise to aid the Heralds in their effort to reclaim heaven. Depending on what your calling was in life, you would receive powers in the afterlife. A farmer would be able to cause whole fields of crops to grow with a single gesture, a spearman could create thunder with his shield and lightning from his spear. Joining the Heraldic forces was the considered to be highest Calling of men.

It was said that the sound of a horn would call the Heraldic Forces to the field of battle.

Once the Heraldic Forces had reconquered the Tranqiline Halls, those who were not chose would awaken from their slumber and return there.</description>

      <description>Extes is a man from Vorin mythology on Roshar.

According to the myth, Extes sacrificed his son to the Voidbringers in exchange for knowledge about the day of his death. He was punished by being made immortal, and then having his arms torn off every day. This tale was well-known in Alethkar, often told among the darkeyes.

His story was one of many involving men made immortal and then tortured for eternity. This is potentially related to the Heralds, who were immortal and tortured in Damnation after every Desolation.</description>

      <description>Frillbloom is a family of plants native to Roshar. It is common in the chasms of the Shattered Plains, and grows larger there than it does in other places.

Frillbloom leaves are fanlike fronds that wave gently in the air. When startled, they fold in on themselves like a hand folding into a fist. They also close up when a storm is approaching.

Colors vary between different frillbloom species, and include yellow, orange, red, and violet. In some varieties, the fronds are veined. Other varieties have spines on the tips of the leaves.

Kaladin makes note of lifespren dancing around frillbloom fronds in the chasms.</description>

Rashek spread rumours that Alendi stabbed Fedik himself.

Fedik himself was suspicious of the Terrismen who guided the party, fearing that they would abandon the group at the top of the mountain.</description>

Teven is killed and replaced by the impostor OreSeur, a member of Kelsier's crew. Acting the role of Lord Renoux and guided by Kelsier, he moves to Fellise ostensibly to expand his business in selling Southern weapons in the North — however, this is a front used by Kelsier in order to arm the skaa rebellion. It is assumed that Renoux intends on making enough money and connections to build a keep in Luthadel by the end of the decade, thereby establishing their family as a Great House.</description>

- Lightsong speaking with Gagaril

Gagaril is a guard in Mercystar's palace. He is not armed, however, as the people of Hallandren do not believe anyone would attack a Returned; his duty is simply to keep anyone from wandering in and bothering the goddess while she slept.

He was on duty when Vasher broke in. Vasher was pretending to be a madman to get close, then attacked Gagaril, choking him to the point of unconsciousness with his awakened cloak tassels, was interviewed along with Fran, the other guard who was at the door, by Lightsong about the attack.

Lightsong mocks his name by asking if his father came up with it while drunk, before sending him and Fran to stand away from the others so he can individually corroborate each of their stories.</description>

      <description>A glyphward is a Vorin prayer written in glyphs with the intention of being burned.

Many scientifically-minded Rosharans deplore glyphwards as pure superstition, with some wondering why, if the Almighty is omniscient, he needs to have a prayer burned to him before he can aid someone. Nonetheless, they remain a minority, and for most Vorins, glyphwards are the main avenue for communicating with the Almighty. For them, if the prayer fails to be answered, it's simply His will.</description>

      <description>Faultline is an powerful Epic, though she does not have any immortality benefits. She worked for Steelheart but later rebelled against him, resulting in her death.

Faultline was a thin woman who wore her hair in a bun. She had two second-tier abilities--moving softer earth and turning earth and stone into sand--which combined into a first-tier power. She was powerful, but fragile. Faultline is only ever seen using her powers when she sends the First Union Bank deep underground by turning the earth into sand, and letting it sink. She also creates a cushion of earth around the bank as it sank, ultimately protecting it. It is also known that Faultline can appear to make earthquakes, by softening the earth and pulling back on it, though it is never shown.</description>

      <description>The Faithful are those who believe that good Epics exist, ones who will use their power for protection rather than domination. The term comes into use after Calamity and the Epics arrive and begin terrorizing humanity. The Faithful think that there will eventually be "superheroes" who will stop the evil Epics.

Blain Charleston (David's father) and Abraham are known to be among the Faithful.

David initially thinks people with such faith are foolish: his early life at Havendark Factory teaches him to be a realist, but to be one of the Faithful requires a certain idealism. However, he eventually comes to believe that Prof is a hero despite being an Epic, though this belief does not transfer to a broader hope for Epics in general.

In the alternate universe, the Faithful include Epics who use their powers for good against evil. These Epics include Blain Charleston, Firefight and Tavi.

The symbol of the Faithful is described as a "stylized S shape"; Abraham always carries a pendant in that shape. When David travels to Babilar, Abraham also gives him a pendant as a gift, and David often thinks about it afterward. Although it could not explicitly be described as such in the books for legal reasons, the symbol is meant to be the real-world Superman logo.</description>

      <description>The Great Concourse of Kharbranth is a school training surgeons in the city of Kharbranth on Roshar. Tuition is quite expensive and they don't admit students younger than sixteen.

Vathe, a resident of Shorsebroon in the Alethkar, trained as a surgeon in the Concourse. At some point after Vathe settled in Shorsebroon, he took on Lirin as his apprentice.

Before joining the army, Kaladin planned to apply to study and train at the Concourse. After Roshone moved to Hearthstone and began targeting Kaladin's family, Lirin and Hesina sent a letter to the surgeons of the Concourse requesting permission for Kaladin to sit the entrance exams early. Unfortunately, their request was denied.</description>

They are publicly known as the rival house to House Tekiel. House Izenry is strong enough that an assassination of a Tekiel ally could reasonably be attributed to House Izenry.

In the prelude to the house war prior to the Collapse of the Final Empire, Kelsier killed Charrs Entrone and left his corpse at Keep Tekiel to sow division amongst the nobility. Kelsier believed that House Izenry would initially be blamed for the murder, however, further investigations into Entrone's death would increase confusion, potentially making someone think another actor wanted to strengthen the Izenry-Tekiel rivalry.</description>

He is around twelve years old. He is darkeyed, and has sandy hair with a few hints of black.

During the course of Highprince Torol Sadeas's investigation into the broken girth strap of Elhokar's saddle, he interviewed Fin. Fin told him that he personally put the king's favorite saddle on his horse, but he noticed that the saddle had been changed before the head grooms took the horse to the Kholin warcamp. Sadeas brought a very nervous Fin to one of the king's feasts to give his testimony. This proved to be a crucial piece of evidence proving Dalinar's innocence in the attempt on Elhokar's life.</description>

"Lady Heir, I made the chest and bodice extra tight to give support - and cut the skirts so they would resist flaring - in case you need to jump. There are slits for metal vials in each of the cuffs, as well as a ripple in the cloth cut to obscure a dagger strapped around each forearm. I hope you find the alterations suitable.

Elend Venture has one of their books on his table during a ball at Keep Elariel. Elend thinks Vin was reading Heberen's thick book, instead of what Vin was actually reading, Deluse Couvre's Book of False Dawn.

Vin says she pretended to read the book so men at the ball would leave her alone.</description>

She was used as a statement by Straff to tell Elend that he can get one just like Vin, only younger and prettier. She was quickly dismissed after Vin let Straff know that they didn't have the atium, with Vin dismissed as well.

After Vin and Elend leave, Straff sends for her once again so that he could feel in charge once again, presumably raping her.</description>

HunFoor defended the decision, saying that they could not have known Kelsier would succeed when everyone else failed, and Kelsier paid so well. KanPaar then harshly cut him off, as it wasn't good for the Second Generation to defend themselves.

TenSoon describes HunFoor as someone who never fit in with his generation, and was more dense than other Seconds.</description>

Gallingskaw believed that there was a divine mandate among common men and that divinity was not exclusive to the Lord Ruler. Yomen dismissed Gallingskaw as a heretic, saying that someone with logical reasoning ability would not have gotten himself executed.</description>

In, Gevelmar arranged for his youngest daughter Malise to marry the much older Lin Davar. He sent Malise to the Davar estate, along with the appropriate writs of marriage. Gevelmar was a rural lord of little consequence, likely of the fifth or sixth dahn. The marriage was presumably political in nature since Lin needed a new wife and House Davar still had some prestige at the time.

      <description>Glurv is a deserter from the Alethi armies during the War of Reckoning. He is short and overweight, with a swollen face, as if it were trying to burst through it's skin..

At some point in his life, Glurv fought against the Parshendi on the Shattered Plains, but eventually decided to desert the army. Glurv joined a band of deserters in the Frostlands which were lead by Vathah. He was convinced to help defend Macob's caravan by Brightness Shallan Davar. She drew a picture of an idealized Glurv, and which prompted Gaz to ask her for one as well.

Whilst investigating what turns out to be the Unmade Re-Shephir, Veil asks Glurv and Vathah to watch for a repeat of some violence perpetrated in Urithiru. They suspected that a bar fight which ended in a fatal head wound would be duplicated, when in fact the hanging of the Ruthar soldier responsible for the death was copied. Both Vathah and Glurv witness the copycat hanging their victim from an outcropping above one of the stone buildings in the Breakaway and jumping down into the market as the corpse twitched. Glurv pursues the murderer whilst Vathah finds Veil and fills her in, before catching up to Glurv who is waiting by the eastern tunnels the perpetrator ran into. The three of them follow into the tunnel, but Veil runs ahead. He receives a medal from Dalinar Kholin for his help investigating the incidents, which he seems to enjoy gloating about.</description>

One of his pocket watches was worn by King Gregory III, and it helped protect the king from the wild chalklings he discovered.

"It is odd, then, that something man-made should have played such an important part in the discovery of Rithmatics. If His Majesty hadn’t been carrying one of Master Freudland’s new-style pocket watches, perhaps none of this would have ever occurred, and man might have fallen to the wild chalklings."

      <description>"Though we will evaluate you, remember that the final measure of your success or failure belongs to the highspren."

- Ki

Highspren are a type of sapient spren capable of forming a Nahel Bond. Bonding with one makes someone a Knight Radiant of the Order of Skybreakers. Unlike the other kinds of sapient spren, highspren did not stop bonding with Skybreakers after the Recreance. Highspren is usually used as a derogatory term.</description>

In late 1173, during the Weeping at the Shattered Plains, Zahel drank from a bottle of hard honu while he talked to Kaladin about washing the sand in the lighteyed dueling grounds.

The reference to "hard" honu implies that there may be several different types of honu with a variety of alcoholic strengths. Lavis grows throughout Roshar and can also be used to make beer.</description>

      <description>Glowpaste is a fluorescent substance found on Threnody.

As kindling a fire would immediately enrage the ever-present shades, and a fire that goes out therefore cannot be easily replaced, fire is not typically used for illumination in the Forests of Hell. The inhabitants of the Forests rely instead on glowpaste, a liquid that, once mixed, provides a dim, but steady, pale green or blue light. Glowpaste is often placed in glass jars that are tied to poles, serving as lanterns. When the user wants the light extinguished, they simply cover the jar with a black covering. Glowpaste can make shades glow in its light.

There are two variants of glowpaste. The more common type glows green and is far brighter than the blue variant, which is known as Abraham's Fire. The latter has an added benefit, though, in that its light makes wetleek sap glow in the dark.

Silence Montane makes use of glowpaste when hunting bounties, both to light her way and to follow the trail of urine left behind by horses that have drunk wetleek sap mixed with water.</description>

      <description>The forts are settlements on Threnody safe from the Forests of Hell. They are inhabited by fortfolk, who the other inhabitants of the Forests hold in contempt for being to far removed from the Forests. They claim jurisdiction over roadways and the land immediately adjacent to them and assess taxes on the people who live there, though those people are not automatically considered fort citizens. The forts had promised to maintain the roads, but generally fall short. They offer bounties for criminals who flee into the Forest, like Chesterton Divide.</description>

In a tale that Wit tells Kaladin, Fleet was a man who could run faster than a Highstorm. Wit also claims that his story is well-known by all, but Kaladin doubts this as he had never heard of Fleet before. The story suggests similarities between Fleet and Kaladin.

During the Diagram's assassination attempt on Elhokar, Kaladin remembers the story of Fleet, who kept running and never stopped. This inspires him to keep going, as all men eventually die and all that truly matters in the end is how they fight to survive, not their deaths.</description>

      <description>Fenweed is a poisonous plant that grows in the Forests of Hell on Threnody.

The primary property of fenweed is to induce extreme headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, sleepiness, and a cloudy-head. Fenweed has a very light taste, so it can easily be masked by the flavor of food or beer.

Fenweed has to be mixed into a paste to be used. A full dose of fenweed in a man's meal or drink is enough to put him straight to sleep. A half dose will leave him mostly unaffected for a while, but after a time he will fall asleep, although not so deeply that he could not be roused.

The name of fenweed implies that it can be found in swamps.

Silence Montane has her daughter, William Ann, give Chesterton Divide and the four men of his gang a half dose of fenweed in their beer, so that she can later kill them in their sleep.</description>

      <description>Forescout is a surname taken by the first family of those from the Homeland that settled in the Forests of Hell on Threnody. Many others came later, but the Forescouts were the first. They are, and have always been, people who lived by the forest, as opposed to the fortfolk, who are more civilized, but choose to ignore the forests instead of becoming one with them. The Forescousts are extremely proud of their heritage. They claim that they can look the forests "dead on", while the fortfolk and others look away. The Forescouts have lived through many dangers, and can be very harsh, as a way of teaching their children how to survive in the Forests of Hell.</description>

      <description>"Is water of life. It is connection to gods. If Unkalaki swim in it, sometimes they see place of gods."

- Rock on the Horneater oceans

The Horneater Oceans are a series of thermal hot springs in the Horneater Peaks on Roshar. They are sometimes called the Emerald Pools for their distinct color. They house Cultivation's Perpendicularity.

Most high mountains in the Horneater Peaks have a crater filled with water at their top. This water is hot, providing pockets of livable space around each Ocean. The temperature drops drastically at a short distance from the lakes, however, making survival in the Peaks without them all but impossible.</description>

      <description>"The Grand Aurora encircled the entire world, and even the mightiest storms did little more than churn its mother-of-pearl shimmering. The Aurora defeated storms; that was how I knew I’d someday be able to do it too."

- Kai about the Grand Aurora

The Grand Aurora is a celestial phenomenon on Alornia, a source of constant blue-violet light in the sky. It encompasses all of Alornia, and gives out mother-of-pearl shimmering that can be seen through even the worst weather conditions. When dark, the Aurora faintly lights the ground, making everything look slightly blue.

The Grand Aurora gives off a constant energy, though this energy is only noticeable when an individual has entered Lancesight. While in Lancesight the Aurora can be seen indoors, even through stone ceilings, and its energy can be felt as a warm, pulsing rhythm on the skin. This energy allows the Aurora to act as a constant energy source for Lancing.

As the Grand Aurora is programming specific to Alornia, it only manifests in Alornia and the connected Border States. Similar phenomena can likely be found in other States.</description>

      <description>"Gravatonics couldn't make things fly; they were just used to reduce recoil or to make heavy items easier to move."

- David, about gravatonics

Gravatonics is a technology in The Reckoners series. Like many other kinds of technology, it was developed after the Calamity. Presumably it allows some kind of gravity manipulation, in particular, decreasing the effect of gravity, or even inertia on the object. It does not, however, allow objects to fly or hover.

Gravatonics applied to objects looks like palm-sized glowing ovals. The color of the glow can vary. The rings can be chipped and/or cracked on impact, decreasing their efficiency.

Gravatonics are often used for guns, both to ease transportation and operation and to reduce the recoil. Other uses includes belts that allow things to be carried more easily and motorcycle stabilization that allows bikes to tilt at the angle that would normally lead to a crash, and softens the landings in case of jumps.</description>

      <description>"Bringing an inanimate thing to life this way is evil. To do it, the Oculator has to give up a bit of his own humanity and store it in Glass of Alivening. That’s what those eyes are made of. Shoot it, Sing. If you hit it in the eye, you may be able to kill it."

- Bastille

Glass of Alivening, also known as Alivener's Glass, is a kind of Silimatic glass that is used to create Alivened and by Scrivener's Bones to augment their bodies. Usually, a bead or two of glass serve as eyes of the creature to be Alivened. In case of Scrivener's Bones, a single bead replaces one of their organic eyes. To charge the Glass of Alivening, an Oculator stores part of his "humanity" (things like capacity to love, protect others, and have mercy) in a bead. Destroying the beads is usually enough to destroy an Alivened. While the glass gives the resulting creature the ability to function, it is the material that it is made of that determines its temperament.

Some people consider Alivening to be dark Oculary, so it is not commonly used in Free Kingdoms.</description>

      <description>"Later that night, he performed the Great Transfersion, an awesome display of power by which he transformed most of Chicago -- buildings, vehicles, streets -- into steel. That included a large portion of Lake Michigan, which became a glassy expanse of black metal. It was there that he built his palace."

- David

The Great Transfersion, or the Day of Annexation, was an act performed by Steelheart near the beginning of his reign in Newcago, presumably as part of his ploy to make as many people fear him as possible and thereby prevent his weakness from being used against him. In the grand display of his Epic powers, Steelheart transformed a massive area into solid steel, including most of the old city of Chicago, a large portion of Lake Michigan, and the earth hundreds of feet underneath. During the early years of his reign, Steelheart made his Diggers carve out several levels of understreets in the steel.

Steelheart's transfersion ability, while very powerful, has some limitations. The effect radiates out from him like sound waves, transforming anything it touches into steel; however, anything already made of metal, especially steel or iron, reduces the effect of the power, and a sufficient amount can stop it entirely. As a result, the contents of the bank vault of the First Union Bank were mostly protected; the Reckoners eventually reach the vault and go through its contents while looking for clues to Steelheart's weakness. Living beings are also entirely unaffected by Steelheart's transfersion, as is anything very close to a living being.</description>

      <description>Lord Gave Entrone is an amateur archaeologist in New Seran. He bought a few of the coins recovered from the Southern Scadrian airship Brunstell.

He attends Kelesina Shores' party and Wax wants to avoid him since he once dated Gave's cousin, Valette Entrone, but Steris points out that he's one of their best options to talk to, since Wax has had some dealings in textiles with him and he was on a list of people possibly connected to the Bands of Mourning in ReLuur's notebook. When Wax begins asking him about archaeology, he began insulting Wax to provoke a reaction and get an excuse to leave the conversation. After that didn't work, he instead insulted Steris, which caused Wax to snap in anger and instinctively reach for his gun.</description>

      <description>Father Bin is a Survivorist priest from Elendel on Scadrial. He was supposed to be the priest performing Waxillium and Steris's wedding.

Prior to the mistdawn sermon, the rogue kandra Paalm, disguised as a Pathian priest named Larskpur, nailed Father Bin through his eyes to the wall in the chapel while he was still alive, then covered him over with a draping. After people arrived for the service, Paalm started preaching, telling the Survivorists that Kelsier was a false god who had cared only about himself, before revealing Father Bin's corpse. By doing so, Paalm exacerbated tensions between Survivorists and Pathians, pushing Elendel further toward rioting.</description>

      <description>"The second become Fleshstones, which are what really make us into Crystin."

- Bastille's explanation of Crystallia

The Fleshstone is a crystal embedded in the back of the neck of a knight of Crystallia.

Fleshstones are created from one of the three types of crystals that grow in Crystallia. They appear as blue crystals in the back of a Crystin's neck. When removed from a Crystin, they are about the size of two fingers. The act of removing a Fleshstone from a Crystin is considered a deep violation and can lead to the Crystin's death if it is not replaced.

The Fleshstone improves the physical abilities of a Crystin beyond normal human abilities. In particular, it gives them an enhanced speed and strength. It accomplishes this by connecting all the Crystin together through the Mindstone. When one Crystin knows how to do something, every Crystin gets slightly better at it. Crystin can also feel the presence of other Crystin through the Fleshstone. Sensing a Fleshstone is not dependent on the Fleshstone being inside a Crystin. This also creates a weakness in the Knights, that is if the Mindstone is interrupted, an enemy can harm all the Knights through the connection.

Alcatraz sends his Talent through the Fleshstone into every Crystin at the end of the Siege of Mokia.</description>

      <description>The Forgotten Language is the language of the ancient Incarna that Alcatraz the First broke so that no future generations could use the knowledge to bring destruction to themselves. Scholars tried to decipher it for centuries, including Attica Smedry, thinking that its secrets might lead him to the Sands or Rashid. After finding the lens, he was able to write in the language.

The written language appears as random scribbles, including things like random circles, zigzags, and loop-dee-loops. The language has no pattern.

The known Forgotten Language books have various subjects. These include forging a "Truefinders Lens," Smedry Talents, Inhibitors Glass, philosophy, building chariots, chicken selling records, and cooking.

The Highbrary contains one of the most extensive Forgotten Language archives in existence.</description>

      <description>House Harms is a noble house in Elendel, Scadrial.

Members include Jackstom Harms, Steris and Marasi.

Under Jackstom's care, House Harms had grown into a house with an excellent financial status, enough even to bolster the dire financial straits of one of the city's largest, most influential houses. Despite this, their name was unknown in the highest circles of Elendel society, a fact that caused much consternation for the house lord and his daughter Steris. Since there was no male heir, they proposed to remedy this situation by an alliance through marriage with Waxillium Ladrian, lord of House Ladrian, which was in financial trouble after years of supposed mismanagement by the former lord Edwarn Ladrian. The partnership of the two houses became official with the wedding of Waxillium and Steris in 342. In addition to their substantial wealth, the family also had lands in the Outer Estates and owned a mansion in Elendel which served as the primary residence for Steris and Lord Harms. Despite their lower status among the nobility both Steris and Jackstom had a least high enough standing to be invited events such as the Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner. The family had ancestral ties to the Lord Mistborn, and as a result Allomancy ran strong in the family line. This fact made Steris and Marasi targets for the Vanishers.</description>

Wax saw him struggling to load boxes prior to boarding at Steris's request, which he later learned were filled with his house financial ledgers. Herve was meant to share a room on the train with Wayne, who rejected this as he knew that Herve snored. Wayne instead climbed out the window onto the roof of the train, alarming Herve.

During the attack on the train by the Nightstreet Gang, Herve was confused by Wax's instructions to hold on to something as their decoupled train car slowed, not realizing that it would soon be accelerating again through Wax's use of the Metallic Arts.</description>

The Taisha Meeting Hall, a chamber within the Hall of Judgment, is the meeting place of Lossand's ruling council, the Taishin. This meeting chamber is a large, circular room with a high ceiling. Around the perimeter of the room are seats at different levels for those who attend meetings, with seats for each Taisha just above the main floor. Visitors who address the Taishin speak from the open floor. The Taishin met at the Hall of Judgment to discuss and vote on disbanding the Diem.

The Trackt Hall, headquarters for the trackts, is also located within the Hall of Judgment.

A clerk sits at a desk outside the main entrance to the Hall of Judgment and is responsible for greeting, admitting, and announcing visitors.

Khrissalla visited the Hall of Judgment in hopes of meeting with the Lady Judge to discuss Gevalden's activity in Kezare.</description>

      <description>House Innate is a noble family in Elendel.

Notable members include Winsting Innate and former Governor of Elendel Replar Innate.

House Innate was one of the most powerful noble houses in Elendel. How the Innates made their fortune is unknown, but both Winsting and Replar were know to give out political favors in exchange for money. Additionally, the House seems to have come to prominence after the Catacendre as no mention is made of their existence during the time of the Final Empire. Their corruption and the deaths of both primary members of the house in 342 greatly damaged the its reputation. As Winsting was an Allomancer, the ability is present in the family bloodline.

The main political rival of House Innate is House Lekal.</description>

Honor's Path is a honorspren ship in Shadesmar, previously captained by Notum and crewed by mistspren and honorspren. The vessel may have been built before the fall of the Radiants.</description>

      <description>Hornhollow is a village in Sadeas princedom close to Hearthstone. It is part of the Akanny region - a prized farming area that supplies grain, meat and other provisions for large portions of Alethkar. Hornhollow would be considered a fairly large town by the local standards and has a small militia. It resides on the Highprince's lands and the surrounding area is worked by high ranking darkeyes.

The village lies in a depression, protected from the Highstorm by a large hill to the east. Within the town are approximately two dozen structures, including two storm sanctuaries that can be used by passing travellers to shelter from the storms. There are also many structures nearby that don't reside within the village proper. In the centre of the town is a cistern used to collect and filter rainwater.</description>

      <description>"A legend. Considered pseudohistorical. Dovcanti wrote an epic about it somewhere around fifteen hundred years ago. The claim is that some Voidbringers survived Aharietiam, and there were many clashes with them afterward. It's considered unreliable, but that’s because many later ardents insist that no Voidbringers could have survived. I'm inclined to assume this is a clash with parshmen before they were somehow deprived of their ability to change forms."

- Jasnah Kholin on the False Desolation.

The False Desolation, considered pseudohistorical by the Vorin church, was a conflict between singers and humans sometime during the millenia after the Last Desolation. It is likely the conflict in which the Knights Radiant were fighting at the time of the Recreance, according to Jasnah Kholin. It resulted in the enslavement of singers as parshmen.</description>

The Fused are the souls of ancient singers that are able to be reborn by possessing the bodies of living singers. They are considered to be higher in singer society than Regals and common singers. They seem to have powers similar to Surgebinding; however, unlike the Knights Radiant, there are only nine orders of them, rather than ten.</description>

Gitgeth is a listener who attends the feast in Kholinar the night of Gavilar Kholin's assassination.

He wears rubies in his beard and has prominent red colors in his skin. He's considerate, worrying about the parshmen and letting Eshonai go her own way and explore the Kholinar palace while he and the others handled the unloading of the drums.

His fate after the feast is uncertain. As only the original Council of Five stayed behind to take responsibility for the assassination, it's possible that he fled to the Shattered Plains along with Eshonai and the rest, but what happened to him afterwards is unknown.</description>

However, Ellista discarded that notion and insulted Fiksin, claiming Fiksin was not a true scholar. Then, she provided evidence that the Dawnchant writing system was used all across Roshar.</description>

Like his father and sister, Gift may be able to see spren. Gift is the only one of his siblings who speaks enough Alethi to manage a passable greeting.

Gift was converted to Vorinism, with his father's blessing, by Veden monks who came to the Horneater Peaks. He arrived at the Shattered Plains with his family in after traveling for months to meet with Lunamor, who had sent them a message shortly after his arrival. Gift's caravan was attacked by Voidbringers and his family barricaded themselves behind a pile of furniture. During the attack a member of his family shot a Voidbringer with an Unkalaki arrow. They were found by Bridge Four during a patrol and taken to Urithiru. Lunamor was surprised by how much Gift had grown during the time he was away. After settling in Urithiru, Gift helped his father serve food and drink to Bridge Four.

Along with his sister Cord, Gift stays with those at Urithiru, when Lunamor returns to the Peaks.

Gift likes Lift and leaves food out for her to "steal".</description>

      <description>The Grips are a gang of thugs in Kholinar on Roshar.

During the Siege of Kholinar, Shallan Davar (in her Veil persona) starts bringing food to displaced people in the city including Grund, Tai, Muri, Ma, and Seland. Unbeknownst to Shallan, her conspicuous actions quickly attract the attention of the Grips. They start forcing the refugees to wait all day for Veil's deliveries; Grund says that they beat him if he leaves his post or tries to take any food for himself. The Grips also blame Grund if Veil does not bring much food.

Shallan eventually realizes that something is wrong, and discovers the Grips eating as Grund watches. The Grips are spooked, and one of the gang members smashes Grund's head open before fleeing. Before dying, Grund tells Shallan that he hates her, and that the Grips had already killed Tai due to the attention that Veil drew. Seland and Ma have already abandoned the area, and Muri plans to do the same. Shallan blames herself for being so naive and causing more harm than good, and is particularly guilt-ridden about Grund's death.

Wit arrives and tries to console Shallan, telling her that other people in the market had asserted themselves against the Grips, forcing them to give up Grund's murderer and disperse.</description>

      <description>Grund is an urchin in Kholinar.

Because of his malformed hand, he attracts Shallan's attention. He keeps it tucked into his sleeve, but is capable with his good hand. Shallan, trying to get the attention of the revel, takes enough food for extras. She takes pity of Grund, and starts handing out food. He is usually very happy to see her. What she doesn't know is that the Grips, a gang in Kholinar, find out about this, and they force Grund to hand over whatever she brings. Grund had to spend all day waiting for her gifts so that the Grips could take it.

One time, Grund acts strained and lies to her that he is fine. When Shallan brings in a meager load, Grund accepts it, but the Grips do not. They get angry and kill Grund. Shallan, suspicious, had stayed back and saw the whole thing. Grund lived long enough to tell Shallan how much he and all of the other people she 'blessed' hated her.</description>

Guff is an older man who is half a reed tall and has some sort of injury that affects his walking and movement. It is likely that he has an accent that is associated with the caravaneers.

He was an old friend of Moash's from before the younger man traveled to the Shattered Plains. Moash found Guff again in Revolar after the city had been conquered by the singers. Guff had taken up employment as a guard for the local Brightlord, Paladar. He was tasked with keeping people out of the Brightlord's tents and also alerting Paladar to any soldiers who were captured. He was surprised to see Moash, as he had assumed the other man to be dead.

Finding out that Moash had at some point been a soldier, Guff took him to see Paladar, however, Moash's silence when asked questions by the Brightlord led to Guff being beaten and replaced.</description>

      <description>Golombi is a scholar on Stormlight growth.

Golombi's work suggests that Stormlight-infused gemstones could enhance food growth in dark rooms. However, Golombi thinks the results may be compromised. There is additionally a problem regarding efficiency.

Taravangian and Adrotagia knew of Golombi's work, and Taravangian mentioned Golombi to distract Adrotagia in Urithiru.</description>

      <description>Hesh is a singer with Khen and Sah as their group traveled with Kaladin to Revolar.

She had worked the kitchens of a manor prior to the Everstorm. Once the group of singers made it into a storm bunker, Hesh inspected sacks of vegetables--which Kaladin had haggled for--with a critical eye.

It's unknown whether she traveled with Khen and Sah to Kholinar and fought in the Battle of Kholinar, and if so, if she survived the battle.</description>

Adolin Kholin quoted several axioms attributed to Halad while he and Shallan discussed confronting Re-Shephir in the lower levels of Urithiru.

It is not clear if Halad is a contemporary or historical figure. As a Highlord, he is presumably a lighteyes of the third dahn.</description>

      <description>Harth is a swordsman from Alethkar on Roshar. He was Dalinar Kholin's first sword trainer.

Dalinar's father hired Harth to train a young Dalinar in swordsmanship. The Kholin family was not particularly powerful at the time, and had to settle for Harth even though he was young and not recognized as a true swordmaster. He came from "a few towns over" to train Dalinar. Dalinar believes that Harth had a reasonable level of skill for someone of his standing.

Dalinar tells Kadash a tale of Harth insisting that he tie his takama in a specific way, the same way that Harth's master and his master's master had always demanded. Dalinar seeks out the originator of this rule, an old ardent in Kholinar, and realizes that he only tied it that way because he was so short. Dalinar uses this tale to argue that blindly following tradition does not make it worthy.

"Tradition? Kadash, did I ever tell you about my first sword trainer?

Back when I was young, our branch of the Kholin family didn't have grand monasteries and beautiful practice grounds. My father found a teacher for me from two towns over. His name was Harth. Young fellow, not a true swordmaster -- but good enough.

He was very focused on proper procedure, and wouldn't let me train until I'd learned how to put on a takama the right way. He wouldn't have stood for me fighting like this. You put on the skirt, then the overshirt, then you wrap your cloth belt around yourself three times and tie it.

I always found that annoying. The belt was too tight, wrapped three times -- you had to pull it hard to get enough slack to tie the knot. The first time I went to duels at a neighboring town, I felt like an idiot. Everyone else had long drooping belt ends at the front of their takamas.

I asked Harth why we did it differently. He said it was the right way, the true way. So, when my travels took me to Harth's hometown, I searched out his master, a man who had trained with the ardents in Kholinar. He insisted that this was the right way to tie a takama, as he'd learned from his master.

I found my master's master's master in Kholinar after we captured it. The ancient, wizened ardent was eating curry and flatbread, completely uncaring of who ruled the city. I asked him. Why tie your belt three times, when everyone else thinks you should do it twice?

The old man laughed and stood up. I was shocked to see that he was terribly short. 'If I only tie it twice,' he exclaimed, 'the ends hang down so low, I trip!'

I love tradition, I've fought for tradition. I make my men follow the codes. I uphold Vorin virtues. But merely being tradition does not make something worthy, Kadash. We can't just assume that because something is old it is right."

In, Dalinar and Gavilar and their armies were stationed at a highstorm shelter just inside Evavakh lands, threatening Evavakh and collecting tribute from the farms nearby. The waystop was used for over four months, and various nobles traveled to the waystop to dine with the Kholins. Notably, a visiting Toh and Evi attended a feast, leading to Dalinar and Evi meeting for the first time. During the meal, Dalinar thwarted an assassination attempt on Gavilar; Torol Sadeas assumed that House Evavakh was behind it.</description>

- Syl

Honor's Perpendicularity is one of Roshar's two perpendicularities, alongside Cultivation's.

It's considered highly dangerous and has a habit of moving around, appearing in various places at random. What usually causes it to appear or vanish is unclear, as is how closely it is linked with the highstorms. During the True Desolation, Honor's Perpendicularity can be opened at will by the Bondsmith Dalinar. This was not possible for previous Bondsmiths. After Ishar saw Dalinar opening the perpendicularity, the Herald is able to replicate the feat.</description>

At some point in her life, Fed became a low level member of the Set, possibly as a part of the Hidden Guard. She accompanied the group of the Set that was lead by Edwarn and Telsin Ladrian to the Sovereign's temple in the Seran Range. When Edwarn fled the Temple in the Hunter airship after Waxillium was given the Bands of Mourning, Fed used her Feruchemy to prime the weight-changing machinery so the ship could take off. She was presumably captured along with the other members of the Set onboard when Wax defeated Edwarn and used his Allomancy to stop the ship from escaping.</description>

House Hamaradin was known to have a spy network, and Brightlady Hamaradin was personally involved in these activities. Ishnah claimed to have been trained as a spy for House Hamaradin, learning various techniques such as information gathering and message coding. Mraize investigated Ishnah and found that she did indeed perform espionage for House Hamaradin, but was merely an assistant rather than a true spy.

At one point, Ishnah overheard Brightlady Hamaradin talking about the Ghostbloods. Ishnah believed that Hamaradin somehow crossed the Ghostbloods and they killed her. She may have died after the Alethi moved from the Shattered Plains to Urithiru, as some of the people in House Hamaradin's employ were accused of the murder and went underground there.</description>

      <description>The Hidden Guard is a group of red-uniformed people that work within the Set.

While their main function may be to serve as guards to high-ranking members of the Set, such as Telsin and Edwarn Ladrian, they may also serve in other roles, such as technicians. They are very respectful of the ranking members of the Set, referring to them formally and saluting their orders. Fed may be a member of the Hidden Guard.

Telsin and Edwarn brought some members of the Hidden Guard with them on their expedition to the Sovereign's temple. One of the Hidden Guards technicians prepared the Hunter ship for take-off and gave Edwarn a weight medallion so they could take off. He gave Edwarn an update on the ship's preparedness and was ordered by Edwarn to begin with their liftoff. The member of the Hidden Guard asked if they should be waiting for Telsin, but Edwarn told him that she would join them later if she could. The member of the guard then left to initiate the liftoff.</description>

      <description>"Defiance is not ‘Defiant’ to them unless it doesn’t actually defy anything."

- FM describing the hypocrisy of the DDF.

Freyja (callsign FM) is a DDF pilot on Detritus. She is a member of Skyward Flight and one of the only two members who completed and graduated flight school. During her training, she was the ninth member of the flight, however, was assigned a new flight number after the Battle of Alta Second when Skyward Flight was reformed.

She is from the lower caverns, has multiple sisters, and was raised to believe and follow Defiant ideals. She does not know the old stories from Earth.</description>

- Hurl ignoring orders to retreat shortly before she is shot down

Hudiya, Callsign: Hurl, is a cadet in the DDF flight school. She is the third member of Skyward Flight and Spensa's wingmate.

Her callsign, Hurl, comes from a joke Hudiya made during the cadet's first lesson in the starfighter simulators, where most of the cadet's crashed their Poco's instead of flying them. Hurl is from Igneous Cavern.</description>

Dr. Halbeth is involved in studying Spensa's brainwaves and believes the increase in activity in the Writellum section of her brain when interacting with the Krell is proof of the defect. Based on this conclusion, he recommends removing Spensa immediately from Flight School. On Ironsides' orders, Dr. Halbeth condemns Dr. Thior's alternative explanations of Spensa's brain readings.</description>

Admiral Heimline is a pilot in the DDF. It is unclear whether Heimline was a junior or senior Admiral. Heimline fought against the Krell in the Battle of Alta. Heimline did not survive the battle, however, if they did, they would have been considered a First Citizen.

Ironsides may have greatly disliked Heimline, however, it is unclear.</description>

      <description>The First Citizens of the Defiant League are the forty pilots who participate in the Battle of Alta, as well as their families and descendants. They are given special privileges, including special quarters and influence, and their children are given a free entrance into Flight School and do not have to take the entrance exam.

It is likely that many, if not all, of the First Citizen's live in the Deep Caverns, as is the case with Jorgen Weight and his family. Many of those that survived the battle go on to hold high ranking positions either in the DDF or the National Assembly.

The First Citizen's are revered by the people of the Defiant League, with a large statue of the group being placed in Igneous Cavern.

Chaser's family, however, are not considered First Citizen's due to his actions during the battle. Instead, Chaser was branded a coward and his family shunned. Spensa's mother, was offered special housing and privileges in exchange for accepting and endorsing the DDF's story of Chaser's actions, however it is unclear if the family was being offered First Citizen status or just higher merit.</description>

Fresa-class ships participate in the Krell skirmish that occurs on the first day of Flight School for Skyward Flight. Later during her training, Spensa practices in a Fresa ship.</description>

      <description>A Feast of Light is a gathering, party, or event that at least honorspren, and perhaps other varieties of spren, go to.

It is unclear what such a feast entails. Judging from its name, it could involve Stormlight.

On a Reacher ship, Captain Ico gave Adolin Kholin clothing to wear, such as a waistcoat and a jacket, which he adapted to his needs and fashion sense. Once Adolin was dressed, Ico remarked that Adolin looked like an honorspren going to a Feast of Light. It is possible that since Adolin appeared like a lord, that a Feast of Light is a high society event for honorspren or spren.</description>

      <description>"Cold makes water. Water collects in that basin. You drink, and don't die."

- Captain Ico describing the function of a hydrator

A hydrator is a device used to collect water in Shadesmar on Roshar.

It's about three feet tall and made entirely out of steel. A number of prongs akin to tree branches surround a central column rising from a round basin at the bottom. There is a hole in the center, just large enough for one of Shadesmar beads to be inserted.

To function, a hydrator requires a bead corresponding to ice that comes from a high place, high enough that it would never melt. When manifested in Shadesmar, the bead begins to emanate cold. It is then inserted into the hydrator. Eventually, mist begins to collect on the prongs and drip down into the basin, producing drinkable water. It takes about an hour to make a small cup.

Kaladin speculates that the hydrator somehow pulls the water out of the ice through the bead. Shallan, on the other hand, is confident that it simply collects moisture from the surrounding air through condensation, similar to how a glass of cold drink will start collecting droplets of water on its outside. In this setup, the ice bead serves only to cool the metal.

As spren do not require water, a working hydrator is a clear sign of human presence in Shadesmar. Spren ships that expect to pick up human passengers will carry them on board.</description>

      <description>"Hatham does an excellent job as Highprince of Works, but there isn’t proper infrastructure... Equally important, Brightness, we might be facing a severe labor shortage."

- Issues faced by living in Urithiru

The Highprince of Works is a title bestowed by the Alethi king onto one of his highprinces on Roshar. It is unclear if the Highprince of Works role existed previously when kingdom duties were split between the different highprinces. It is currently held by Highprince Hatham.

The Highprince of Works appears to be responsible for kingdom's public works, such as cleaning and maintaining the infrastructure. In Urithiru, he's responsible for the upkeep of public lavatories, providing water to the inhabitants of the tower and packing goods to be distributed throughout the Alethi holdings. He has the ability to draft the soldiers, caravan workers, and low-nahn citizens to work, although his power in this regard is limited, as they are not slaves and require compensation for their work. In addition, his men are attempting to grow food on Urithiru's balcony-farms, though so far they haven't had much success.

In the time period between Gavilar's unification of the country and the True Desolation, Alethkar did not have a Highprince of Works. In the aftermath of the Everstorm's arrival, Hatham was given the title and tasked with making Urithiru livable for its current population. Though he is doing as admirably, the semi-functional state of the tower city makes his task extremely difficult and living in the tower is unsustainable without outside trade. He has also received push back from members of the lower class who do not wish to assist with tasks previously performed by parshmen, as they believe they are above menial tasks.</description>

- Morriumur

The Human Wars are a series of three historical conflicts between humanity and other sapient species of the galaxy, all motivated by humanity's desire to conquer all others. They concluded with humanity's defeat, and the subsequent formation of human enclaves like Detritus, as well as the Superiority, the current chief political power of the known universe.</description>

      <description>"[I] went to check on him a couple times, like you asked. You'll find him three streets west of the Fourwell Crossroads."

- Dockson to Kelsier on Camon

Fourwell Crossroads is an intersection in Luthadel on Scadrial. Its name comes from its four wells, one in each of its corners. It also has a copper fountain in its center, which depicts the Lord Ruler with the Deepness defeated and lying at his feet.

Many people pass though Fourwell Crossroads, which makes it a popular spot for beggars to set up, though they have to fight to maintain their place there. After Kelsier had him made a beggar, Camon did not get a spot at Fourwell Crossroads, and had to set up at a smaller and less popular square three streets to the west.</description>

      <description>The fain or fainlife is a class of lifeforms on Yolen. Although fainlife looks like ordinary flora, the plants and land overtaken by it are bone-white, and spill red liquid when crushed or snapped. The Sho Del fill the same niche in the fain ecosystem that humans fill in the normal one. Another form of fainlife is Tamu Keks, bones that are somehow similar to singer gemhearts and can be used for inter-Realm communication in some way.

The existence of fainlife remains known to cosmere-aware people after the Shattering of Adonalsium; when discussing how Ruin and Preservation used the Yolish ecosystem as a model for Scadrial, Khriss was able to mention without further explanation that "of course" this means the non-fain parts.</description>

      <description>"I only tell stories, Your Grace. They may be truths, they may be fictions. All I know is that the stories themselves exist and that I must tell them."

- Hoid to Siri on the truth of his stories

"I learned it many, many years ago from a man who didn't know who he was, Your Majesty. It was a distant place where two lands meet and gods have died."

- Hoid to Siri on where he learned his particular method of storytelling.

"The foolishness of men who care, Dalinar, and the brilliance of those who do not. The second depend on the first&mdash;but also exploit the first&mdash;while the first misunderstand the second, hoping that the second are more like the first. And all of their games steal our time. Second by second."

- Hoid to Dalinar

"Nonsense. Balderdash. Figgldygrak. Isn't it odd that gibberish words are often the sounds of other words, cut up and dismembered, then stitched into something like them&mdash;yet wholly unlike them at the same time? I wonder if you could do that to a man. Pull him apart, emotion by emotion, bit by bit, bloody chunk by bloody chunk. Then combine them back together into something else, like a Dysian Aimian. If you do put a man together like that, Dalinar, be sure to name him Gibberish, after me. Or perhaps Gibletish."

- Hoid to Dalinar (after namedropping Adonalsium)

"I've abandoned my real name. But when next we meet, I'll think of a clever one for you to call me. Until then, Wit will suffice&mdash;or if you must, you may call me Hoid."

- Hoid to Dalinar

"I began life as a thought, a concept, words on a page. That was another thing I stole. Myself. Another time, I was named for a rock." "A pretty one, I hope." "A beautiful one," the man said. "And one that became completely worthless for my wearing it."

- Hoid to Kaladin

"What you saw belongs to you. A story doesn't live until it is imagined in someone's mind." "What does the story mean, then?" "It means what you want it to mean. The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon. Too often, we forget that."

- Hoid to Kaladin on stories

"People see in stories what they're looking for, my young friend. I have no answers for you. Most days, I feel I never have had any answers. I've come to your land to chase an old acquaintance, but I end up spending most of my time hiding from him instead."

- Hoid to Kaladin

"Can you feel it? Something just changed. I believe that's the sound the world makes when it pisses itself"

- Hoid to the Kholinar city guards

"What is it we value? Innovation. Originality. Novelty. But most importantly...timeliness. I fear you may be too late, my confused, unfortunate, friend."

- Hoid to Taln

"You must not trust yourself with me. If I have to watch this world crumble and burn to get what I need, I will do so. With tears, yes, but I would let it happen."

- Hoid (as Wit) to Dalinar

"Accept the pain, but do not accept that you deserved it."

- Hoid (as Wit) to Shallan

"How remarkable, [if] you spend your life knocking people down, you eventually find they won't stand up for you. There’s poetry in that, don’t you think, you storming personification of a cancerous anal discharge?"

- Hoid to Ruthar (there are several other notable quotes in this chapter)</description>

      <description>"She once considered these stories fancies, no more real than things like the gloomdancer or sea hags from Thaylen mythology."

- Vstim about Jasnah

The gloomdancer is an unspecified creature in Thaylen mythology. It is considered fictitious by most Rosharan scholars as well as modern Thaylens, alongside sea hags and living heaps of cremlings. However, as the latter have been proven to exist, it's unknown if the gloomdancer is pure fiction, real fact, or folk interpretation of a real being.

Vstim mentions it to Rysn when talking about Queen Jasnah's research into the Sleepless.</description>

      <description>"There's always another secret."

- Kelsier's mantra

Kelsier is a half-skaa Mistborn from Scadrial. He is stern and intense, but always smiling; another act of rebellion against the Lord Ruler's oppression. He hates injustice and takes this hatred to the extreme, which originally resulted in him being unable to see good in any of the nobility. This was changed by Vin who fell in love with Elend Venture. Kelsier went on to save Elend's life from an inquisitor. His late wife Mare collected pre-Ascension memorabilia, and he keeps one piece, a drawing of a flower, to inspire his crew. Kelsier is the younger brother of Marsh, who is disappointed at Kelsier's apparent lack of direction or purpose until Kelsier leads the skaa rebellion. He always keeps a smile on his face, believing that is the best way to fight.</description>

      <description>Kwaan was a Worldbringer of Terris prior to the Final Empire on Scadrial.

He was the first among them to proclaim Alendi as the Hero of Ages, a figure foretold in Terris prophecy. However, his eidetic memory allowed him to remember the prophecy without resorting to his copperminds, which could be manipulated by Ruin. He began to notice discrepancies between the two versions caused by the meddling hand of Ruin. He realized that releasing the power at the Well of Ascension would allow Ruin to be free once more so he sent his nephew Rashek to prevent this from occurring.

He left a metal inscription in the Conventical of Seran describing his discoveries which were later found and copied by Sazed.

Kwaan was among the members of the First Generation of kandra who were offered immortality by Rashek during his Ascension. Kwaan refused the offer, believing it to be a betrayal of who they were as a people. Rashek attempted to destroy him in anger, but was unable to do so due to wielding Preservation's power. Kwaan remained human, fleeing and going into hiding. Rashek eventually hunted him down and executed him.</description>

      <description>Jastes Lekal was a noble of the Final Empire on Scadrial.

He was a friend and compatriot of Elend Venture and Telden Hasting. The three often met at balls and discussed contemporary, even rebellious politics. He and Elend planned to become political allies upon the inheritance of their respective noble houses. His uncle was King Audil Lekal.

After the Collapse Jastes escaped to the Southern Dominance. The lives of some of his family members, including his sister, were lost during skaa uprisings.This was at least in part due to the fact that he tried to implement several of Elends ideas in governing his lands, such as freedom and political honesty, which was seen as a sign of weakness and led to him losing control. As a result, many of his family members were culled off by the new rulers when they took control. He became mentally unstable and recruited an army of koloss by paying them with fake coins. He besieged Luthadel in an attempt to find the Lord Ruler's cache of atium. After losing control over his koloss due to an unforeseen event, Jastes tried to escape north into the Terris mountains. He was eventually caught and executed by Elend Venture, for bringing such destruction down on Luthadel.</description>

      <description>"We chose this burden willingly. Well, we can choose to drop it if we wish."

- Jezrien on the Oathpact

Jezrien, also known as Jezerezeh'Elin, Yaezir and Yaysi, was one of the ten Heralds of The Almighty and the patron of the Order of Windrunners. Jezrien fought in multiple Desolations, defending mankind from the Voidbringers and returning to Damnation between Desolations to be tortured. After centuries of combat, Jezrien abandoned the Oathpact with eight of the other Heralds, pretending the Voidbringers had been defeated once and for all. He went into hiding, gradually losing his mind, while the rest of the world revered his memory and he became a figure of legend over the following millennia.</description>

      <description>"I don't know what I am either. A bridgeman? A surgeon? A soldier? A slave? Those are all just labels. Inside, I'm me. A very different me than I was a year ago, but I can't worry about that, so I just keep moving and hope my feet take me where I need to go."

- Kaladin to Sylphrena

Kaladin, nicknamed Kal, renowned as Kaladin Stormblessed, is a darkeyed Windrunner of the Knights Radiant from Alethkar. Despite being trained as a surgeon from an early age by his father, his chosen profession is that of a soldier. He is famed as the captain of Highprince Dalinar Kholin's personal guard, a unit known as Bridge Four, and commander of the bridgemen battalion.

Kaladin has known adversity and loss throughout his life. He has suffered repeated oppression and betrayal by the lighteyed nobility, including being driven from his home by the citylord of his hometown as a teenager and being sold into slavery by the commander of his army. Kaladin has also been unable to save numerous patients, comrades, subordinates, and even his brother Tien from death.

Despite these challenges, or perhaps because of them, Kaladin is driven to protect others. Utilizing his skills as a surgeon, he attempts to save as many lives as possible. As a soldier, he rescued thousands of soldiers during the Battle of the Tower, liberated a thousand bridgemen, and defended Dalinar Kholin and King Elhokar Kholin from numerous assassins.

He has bonded with the honorspren Sylphrena, more commonly known as Syl. This bond allows him to discover his powers as a Surgebinder and destiny as a member of the Knights Radiant, an order which has been defunct ever since the Day of Recreance. Kaladin, along with Shallan Davar, is one of the first new members of the Knights Radiant in centuries. Their public revelation during the Battle of Narak serves as the catalyst for the re-founding of the Knights Radiant.

After the re-founding of the Knights Radiant, Kaladin helped the expansion of the Knights Radiant by taking on Bridge Four as squires, with most of them eventually becoming Knights themselves.</description>

- The myth behind Kharbranth's nickname, the City of Bells

Kharbranth, the City of Bells, is an independent city-state on Roshar, ruled by Queen Savrahalidem. It is one of the five Vorin nations and home to the Palanaeum, the largest library on Roshar. Kharbranth is known for the quality of its hospitals, and people come from all over the world to study medicine from Kharbranth's surgeons. The Kharbranthian royal colors are burnt orange and white, and have become synonymous around Roshar as the colors of surgeons, medicine, and healing.</description>

      <description>The letters are a set of correspondence between Hoid and several other prominent figures in the cosmere, including Frost, Endowment, Autonomy, and Harmony. Hoid's initial letters express his fears concerning Odium--both his former attacks against various Shards of Adonalsium, his activities on Roshar, and the potential for future devastation throughout the cosmere--and calls for assistance from the recipients. Subsequent letters, all addressed to Hoid, are a response to this call for aid.

In addition to giving some insight concerning the significance of the conflict on Roshar as it relates to the greater cosmere, the letters give some insight into the histories, goals, and personalities of their authors.</description>

      <description>Lerasium is a God Metal. A normal person burning lerasium becomes a Mistborn of undiluted power. A Misting or Mistborn burning lerasium drastically increases their powers. Feruchemists can use lerasium to store an unknown quality, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, lerasium steals all abilities.

Lerasium is notable as it is the condensed power of the Shard Preservation. The only known source were beads found at the Well of Ascension. Presumably, the name "lerasium" is inherited from Leras, the name of the original holder of the Shard Preservation, just as the name atium is inherited from Ati, the original holder of the Shard Ruin. Lerasium cannot be combined with atium to make harmonium, nor can harmonium be broken down into lerasium and atium. While it would not be possible to get lerasium and atium from harmonium through distillation or other mundane methods, through some supernatural means it may be achievable.</description>

- Kaladin and Syl on what the Knights Radiant were like.

The Knights Radiant were an organization of Surgebinders on Roshar. Their Orders were centered at Urithiru, but they lived all across Alethela, the Silver Kingdom who had to maintain the arts of war. They considered it their duty and privilege to stay vigilant for Desolations. It is commonly believed that they betrayed mankind on the Day of Recreance, and were then referred to as the Lost Radiants. Their symbol was a golden hourglass shape, of eight spheres connected with two at the center. The Parshendi call them Neshua Kadal; Radiant Knight.</description>

      <description>The Jeskeri Mysteries is a religious cult on Sel which involves human sacrifice. It is an offshoot of Jesker which Galladon insists is a perversion of Jesker and scarcely related.

Jesker ascribes importance to the heaven's movements, like the moon, and the followers of the Mysteries frequently hold rituals on nights of the full moon.

When Hrathen first talked to Dilaf he wondered about his religious fervor and thought it more in line with the attitudes of followers of the Jeskeri Mysteries rather than those of Shu-Dereth.

Sarene discovered that King Iadon followed the Jeskeri Mysteries and had ritually sacrificed several female palace servants as petitions for supernatual intervention from the Jesker spirits.</description>

      <description>"Awaken to my Breath, serve my needs, live at my Command and at my word. <Security phrase>."

- The Command by which Lifeless can be created with a single BioChromatic Breath.

Lifeless are a type of magical entity originating on the shardworld Nalthis, created by Awakening. They are classified as Type Two Biochromatic Entities: Mindless Manifestations in a Deceased Host.

When an Awakener infuses a skeleton or a corpse (preferably human) with a Breath, it becomes animate without becoming fully alive. This creature is then able to follow specific commands much like any other Awakened creation.

However, Lifeless differ from other Awakened objects in several ways. Firstly, the Breath used to animate them cannot be reclaimed by the Awakener. Secondly, they are much more flexible and intelligent in obeying orders; this is ascribed to the fact that they have a brain and are therefore less reliant on the cognitive impulse from the Awakener to determine their actions. Thirdly, they can be given further commands, or have their previous commands rescinded, without an infusion of more Breath.</description>

      <description>"The stories are wrong, aren’t they? We didn’t defeat the enemy for good, as the Heralds claimed. They lied."

- Dalinar to the Stormfather

The Last Desolation, also known as Aharietiam in Vorin tradition and the Day of Glory in Azir, is believed to be the last Desolation, when mankind's hard-won victory over the Voidbringers ended the cycle of Desolations. In reality, nine of the ten Heralds abandoned their Honorblades in an attempt to leave the Oathpact and avoid further torture on Braize. Talenel was the only Herald not to break the Oathpact. Dalinar Kholin visited this Desolation in one of the visions left by Honor.</description>

- Hoid to Lightsong and Siri.

Kuth is a nation-state on Nalthis. Like Huth, Kuth lies beyond the mountains of Idris.

Along with Huth, Kuth was the main rival to Vasher's Hanald in the Manywar, and eventually fell by the conflict's end. It is unclear if Kuth and Huth were part of the Pahn Unity.

Three hundred years after the Manywar, a tyrant is trying to restore both Huth and Kuth, with Yesteel's help.</description>

      <description>The Keepers of Terris are the major branch of Feruchemists on Scadrial during the Final Empire. Ruled over by the Synod, they copied the practices of the Worldbringers of old in collecting as much information as possible in their metalminds. They tried to stay secret from the world, and the Lord Ruler, who would have them killed for their Feruchemical abilities.

The Keepers amassed knowledge of Scadrial from before the Lord Ruler and the advent of the Final Empire, in the hope of restoring to the people the knowledge and heritage they had lost after Rashek took over the world.

Each Keeper has access to all the stored knowledge of their order, and periodically returns to Tathingdwen, the capital of Terris Dominance, to update their copperminds. Also, each Keeper has a particular area of expertise, such as religions or ancient kings and leaders.</description>

      <description>Kwaan's incription is a message written in steel by Kwaan, warning about Ruin's corruption of the Terris prophecies and denouncing Alendi.

After the Lord Ruler killed Kwaan, he kept the inscription as a reminder of his old life, and it was eventually housed in the Conventical of Seran. After the Collapse, Sazed discovered it when he visited the Conventicle with Marsh, and he took a rubbing of it for later study. Unfortunately Ruin modified it, tricking Vin into giving up the power of the Well of Ascension and letting him back into the world. After Ruin's release, Sazed returned to the Conventicle to read the unmodified version.</description>

      <description>A ketek is a form of holy Vorin poetry which reads the same forward and backward (allowing for changes in verb form), and is also divisible into five sections, each of which also expresses a complete thought. The full poem should be grammatically correct and have a poignant meaning. Vorin poets tend to weight the middle word and build the poet around it. Singer poets, the only currently known one being El, weight the poem differently. El intentionally made the last line longer than the rest.

Keteks are a part of multiple Vorin ceremonies. Keteks are written by the female loved ones of the deceased for funerals. Other keteks are traditionally used in funerals. Both kinds of keteks are spoken aloud before being burned by Ardents as prayers. Keteks are also given to a bride on her wedding day after her makeup is finished.</description>

Jam is two years older than Kaladin. His father served as a soldier in Brightlord Amaram's army where he got injured and was left with a lame leg, which Lirin operated on. Lirin doubted that due to Jam's age difference with Kaladin that he would like to spend time with Kaladin, but Kaladin and Tien watched Jam while he was trained in the quarterstaff by his father.

It's unclear whether Jam is the same as another Jam, who was a caravaneer.</description>

In response, they made their religion as simple as possible. Mare was a follower of the Larsta faith, converting to it after Sazed had preached it to her.

Sazed evaluates Larstaism for truth longer than other pre-Ascension religions because it did not seem to have any illogical or contradictory tenets. He uses their descriptions of Scadrial's pre-ascension plants and animals, such as the Marewill flowers, to model new flora.</description>

      <description>The invasion of Arelon took place on the planet of Sel just before Raoden and Sarene were crowned king and queen of Elantris.

Under the instructions of Dilaf, the armies of Fjorden entered Arelon and attacked Elantris and Kae. They slaughtered New Elantrians and citizens of Kae alike and gathered all Elantrians and survivors into New Elantris, where they piled the Elantrians and the Hoed together to burn, and grouped the humans together to go afterwards. A few of the humans took a last stand, but were defeated.

As this happened, Raoden was taken to the Pool by Galladon and Karata, after being mortally wounded. He resisted the Pool's release and ran down to Elantris to fix the Aon it represents. As a result, the Elantrians' Reod completed, and they started beating the invaders back.

Dilaf kidnapped Sarene and, with Hrathen, jumped to Teoras, where King Eventeo waited to surrender. Raoden followed and the Battle of Teoras began.</description>

- Klade on why he does not worry about the highstorms.

Klade was a Parshendi and member of the Council of Five in Narak on Roshar.

Klade said a voice that spoke to the rhythms led him to Szeth, who was for sale by the slavers in Kholinar. Klade purchased Szeth before the feast celebrating the treaty between the Parshendi and Alethkar. Klade pressured Szeth until he confessed his abilities. That night, the Five ordered Szeth to assassinate Gavilar.

Klade was mentioned in King Gavilar Kholin's accounts of his adventures into the Shattered Plains. He seemed to be a guide to the king's party and had a good command of the Alethi tongue.

Klade did not understand the parshmen servants that the Alethi brought with them, wondering why they had no music.

Klade, Gangnah, and Varnali remained behind in the wake of Szeth's assassination of Gavilar. The three Parshendi took full credit for Gavilar's death, but would offer no explanation beyond that they were attempting to avoid the return of their gods. Klade and the other two were hanged for their crime.</description>

The Ironspine Building is tall enough that even when uncompleted, its top is obscured by the mists on the rare nights they appeared.

The Ironspine Building is in a sort-of race with the Tekiel Tower to be the tallest building in Elendel. The architects would come up with revised blueprints of taller and taller buildings, attempting to outdo one another. Credible rumors said that both the Ironspine Building and the Tekiel Tower would top over fifty stories tall.</description>

Keshu, called Keseg by the Fjordell, was an elderly philosopher from JinDo on Sel. As a great teacher, he was given the honorific KeHwo.

Keshu preached unity of all mankind, though the type of unity was unclear. It has been interpreted by various people to mean unity of mind, love, or obedience. While his teachings were revolutionary, combining traditional JinDo concepts with the idea of god and organized religion, he did not consider himself such. He only wished to clarify previous JinDo beliefs. His two disciples Korath and Dereth collected his teachings in a book called the Do-Keseg. The teachings within this book led to the creation of some of the most powerful Selish religions--Shu-Keseg, Shu-Korath, and Shu-Dereth.</description>

      <description>The Homeland was the secret, underground nation of the kandra on Scadrial during the Final Empire.

It was located in the same mountain range as the Arguois caverns and the Pits of Hathsin, in fact many of its tunnels connected to the latter and had to be kept blocked and guarded. It was located close to Luthadel. After Harmony remade the world an entrance to the Homeland was placed directly under the Field of Rebirth. The caverns of the Homeland were said to be quite large, too large to be filled by the kandra, some members liked the solitude they provided after decades out on Contracts.</description>

      <description>Janarle is a noble from the Final Empire on Scadrial.

He served Straff Venture as a general and took part in the Siege of Luthadel. While Straff is indisposed Janarle effectively leads the army and planned a strike to be executed with Straff's permission. He continues to report the progress of the koloss attack against Luthadel. Straff believed that he might overthrow him if given the knowledge that Zane had disappeared. After Straff was killed in the final battle of that siege, Janarle bowed to the New Empire. After the battle, he tries to argue that they should concentrate their forces on cementing their hold on the Northern dominance. Henceforward he would be the king of the Northern Dominance, administrating from Urteau.

As Quellion began to revolt against the New Empire, Janarle fled from Urteau. On his way through the Northern Dominance he was attacked by koloss and was transformed into one. He took part in the Battle of Hathsin as a koloss. As he did not make it to the front lines, he likely died when the sun rose and began burning the land.</description>

Although Jaador's residents are ethnically JinDo, the nation has been annexed by the Fjordell Empire and the official religion is therefore Shu-Dereth.</description>

      <description>"Jesker teaches that only humans have the ability--or the curse--of being oblivious to the Dor"

- Galladon explaining to Raoden about the Dor

Jesker is a religion practiced on Sel. It is one of the oldest religions on Sel, and was effectively exterminated when the Duladel Republic was overthrown by Hrathen. Many call Jesker a 'primitive' religion, though saying this was considered offensive to its followers.

Jesker appears to involve spirits. The Dor is referred to as the Jesker "overspirit". Jesker is said to look to the Dor and attempt to understand it. Followers of the Jesker religion strive to bring themselves in harmony with the Dor and subsequently with nature, and taught that everything knew of the Dor, except humans, who could be oblivious to it. Jesker also ascribed importance to the heaven's movements, and according to Hrathen, worshipped the moon.

The Jeskeri Mysteries are a religious cult that was related to Jesker, but Galladon insists it is a mockery of true Jesker, who did not have any true understanding of the Dor.

When Raoden first entered Elantris, an Elantrian said that all priests, including Jesker, said that they were damned. This may not be indicative of Jesker itself, as Arelene have more experience with the Mysteries than the defunct Jesker.</description>

      <description>"Many think that my journey started in Khlennium that great city of wonder. They forget that I was no king when my quest began. Far from it. I think it would do men well to remember that this task was not begun by emperors, priests, prophets, or generals. It didn't start in Khlennium or Kordel, nor did it come from the great nations to the east or the fiery empire of the West. It began in a small, unimportant town whose name would mean nothing to you. It began with a youth, the son of a blacksmith, who was unremarkable in every way - except, perhaps, in his ability to get into trouble. It began with me."

- Alendi's journal

Kordel was a location during the Classical Era of Scadrial. Alendi mentions in his journal that, like many other locations, his quest did not begin in Kordel.

Kordel was mentioned in the same breath as Khlennium, and so was possibly a city of importance.</description>

The locals of the Purelake believe that the kolgril is very lucky. It is said to cure aching joints for a month after being eaten, and some also report that it allows you to read the shapes of the clouds to determine when friends are going to visit. It is likely that these rumors are true, to an extent, as many of the fish in the Purelake have formed symbiotic bonds with spren, making them Invested in some way--not unlike Ryshadium or Aviar.

Ishikk caught a kolgril one morning and offered it as a gift to Maib, who had a particular liking for the fish due to aches in her fingers, in order to put her in his debt and avoid her ongoing attempts to bait him into marriage.</description>

      <description>The Incarna were an ancient people that existed possibly around the time of the ancient Egyptians (judging by Alcatraz the First's sarcophagus).

They created the Smedry Talents by some unknown process. They fell victim to a terrible calamity that was related to the Talents. Alcatraz the First broke his people's language so that no future generations could use the knowledge to bring destruction to themselves.

Until Attica Smedry discovered the Sands of Rashid (leading to the forging of two pairs of Translator's Lenses), nobody was able to read the Incarna language. The race between Alcatraz and Co. and the Librarians to be the first to find out the Incarna's secrets is one of the major plot lines of the series.

In the fourth book, Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens, it is revealed that Attica had found out the Incarna's method for creating talents and intended to give them to everyone, which would result in wide-spread destruction. Alcatraz also found out that his mother had been trying to stop his father from doing this.</description>

Kammar is designed to defeat enemies without harming them, and so is considered a peaceful form. It focuses on grabbing people and immobilizing them by using their own weight against them. Only the hands are used in kammar.

Szeth is trained in kammar, so it is possible that this is a Shin-specific art. The grabbing motions are ideal for infusing people with Stormlight, so Szeth is dangerous even with it alone, and without a Shardblade.</description>

      <description>Leky stick is a sport invented in the nation of Svorden in Sel. Although Svorden is annexed by the Fjordell Empire, the sport is still played in multiple nations on Sel in the Late Era.

Leky stick's popularity is such that it expanded from Sycla to the Northern Continent; it is King Eventeo of Teod's favorite sport. He nicknamed his daughter Sarene "leky stick" as a child because she was so tall and thin, just like the pole that marked the goal line. Eventeo later explains the nickname to Raoden, who finds it hilarious and uses it constantly to tease Sarene.</description>

They have been a critically-endangered species since the scouring of Aimia. They are known as the Ancient Guardians, and have traditionally guarded the Dawnshard on Aimia.

The larkin are associated with the Knights Radiant, though the specifics of their connection remain a mystery. One effect of this connection is possibly that Surgebinders can sense a larkin's mood.</description>

      <description>The lanceryn (singular: lancer) are a type of greatshell native to Aimia.

The lanceryn were originally the Ancient Guardians or Guardians of Ancient Sins, tasked with the keeping of the Dawnshard underneath Akinah. Like all greatshells, the lanceryn were enormous. It is likely they could fly and bonded mandras. They, like the modern larkin, had the ability to feed on Investiture. At the fall of their species, the Sleepless took over their role protecting the Dawnshard. Some hordelings had bred with lanceryn prior to their fall, thus passing on the ability to feed on Investiture, albeit in a limited manner.

It is commonly believed that the lanceryn died off during the scouring of Aimia, to the dismay of those who had harvested their gemhearts. They were the last creature known to produce gemhearts of large size prior to the discovery of the chasmfiends on the Shattered Plains. However, it appears that the lanceryn live on in some way in larkins. The Sleepless Nikliasorm believes that Chiri-Chiri, a larkin, is an Ancient Guardian in her own right. It also says that lanceryn are now called larkins. They are "kind of the same species." Although there is some relationship between the two, it is unclear as of yet exactly what that relationship is.

In the undersea caverns of Aimia, there is a room containing six greatshell skulls made of carapace, presumably belonging to lanceryn. They appear to turn to face Rysn while she is in a nearby cavern.</description>

      <description>Joel Saxon is a student at Armedius Academy.

He is not a Rithmatist, but enjoys studying Rithmatics, and excels at mathematics. He is a fantastic line/circle drawer, even though he does not possess the magic properties needed to be a Rithmatist.

Joel is believed to be the only non-Rithmatist ever to encounter a Shadowblaze.</description>

      <description>The  JoSeun Empire was a nation on Earth originating from Asia.

In the history of the Rithmatist, the Mongols were turned to work for the JoSeun empire during the Koreo Dynasty.

The empire invaded and conquered Europe, forcing King Gregory III to flee Britannia and seek refuge in the United Isles of America.

The JoSeun are mentioned as being devoutly Buddhist.</description>

      <description>Inception is the testing and induction ceremony which creates Rithmatists.

Inception is a religious ceremony of the Church of the Monarch and takes place in a Monarchical chapel. On the Fourth of July every year, all the 8-year-olds in the fifty isles are "incepted". Holy water is sprinkled on their heads, and they are blessed and told to enter the chamber of inception. A Shadowblaze is bound to a small and seemingly random portion of the children that go through the Room of Inception, making them Rithmatists. Joel Saxon is one of the very few to have been incepted well after his inception age, as his previous inception was done incorrectly.

      <description>"Hrathen pursed his lips with dissatisfaction: The boy noble had been too easily swayed. As was often the case, the most outspoken man was the least discerning."

- Hrathen's opinion of Idan

Idan is a noble in the Arelene court on Sel.

He is among a group of relatively unimportant young lords (along with his cousin Waren and Ramear) whom Hrathen and Dilaf approach with a proposal to convert to Shu-Dereth. Hrathen plans to start his conversion of Arelon with lesser nobles, and believes that more important nobles will join them as he destabilizes the government.

Idan is initially confused as to how converting will benefit him and the other nobles, and wonders who Hrathen perceives as the enemies of the Derethi. Hrathen appeals to the nobles' underlying insecurity and thirst for power by pointing out that many Arelene still cling to the idea that the Elantrians will one day return, which undermines the power of the throne. Idan is easily swayed to his cause, but Hrathen does not place any value on his change of heart since he was too easy to convince.</description>

Jason and Lanna have a working relationship that, while very efficient, is very heavy on teasing each other. She frequently refers to him as, "Old Man," to his consternation. In return he complains quite convincingly whenever she is assigned as his support, despite the fact that he is actually the one who does the assigning. Despite always telling Jason that his outlook on the human race's situation was too idealistic, she always wanted to believe that he was right after all.</description>

- Llarimar on Kindwinds

Kindwinds the Honest is a Returned on Nalthis, revered as a god by the people of Hallandren. Despite his title, he often lied while politicking.

Llarimar was formerly one of his priests, and Kindwinds's actions caused Llarimar to lose faith in the Iridescent Tones. Llarimar's faith was later restored when he witnessed his brother Stennimar becoming a Returned.</description>

      <description>Korath (KoHwo) was the founder of the Shu-Korath religion.

He was a student of Keseg, who began the religion Shu-Keseg. Keseg preached unity, and his two disciples, Korath and Dereth, interpreted this in different ways. Dereth took it to mean unity of governance, while Korath understood it as unity of love. The two split to create two different religions, Shu-Dereth and Shu-Korath.

Korath adopted the Elantrian symbol Aon Omi to represent both his church and its God. This was a surprising choice, as many new followers of Shu-Korath considered Aons and the Elantrian religion to be heathen. However, by adopting the symbol, Korath hoped to prove that his church should love everybody. The center of Shu-Korath was eventually moved to Teod, after Korath's death.

He had a pendant with the symbol forged, which eventually evolved into the current practice of exchanging Omi pendants at Korathi weddings, as well as the habit of many followers of Shu-Korath wearing the pendants. The pendants eveventually became known as Korathi pendants.</description>

      <description>Lastport is a city on Threnody, one of the Fortress Towns near the Forests of Hell.

Lastport is the most powerful city on its continent. Daggon notes that Lastport resident Lamentation Winebare has a squeaky, noticeable accent.

As a Fortress Town (or "fort"), it is one of the few areas on the continent where people can live without constant fear of attack by shades. The residents of the forts dress fashionably and consider themselves "civilized" compared to the homesteaders that live in the Forests.

Theopolis has connections in Lastport and travels there when he needs to collect bounties in the name of the White Fox (Silence Montane). Prices of silver are on the rise in both Lastport and Bastion Hill.

The governor of Lastport was murdered under unknown circumstances by highwayman Chesterton Divide. The city of Lastport offered an enormous bounty for Chesterton, calling him an anarchist, psychopath, and menace; when Chesterton visits Silence's waystop she immediately plans to kill him and his gang, believing that the proceeds will fund her operations for at least a year.

The elite of Lastport have begun to worry about Silence's waystop being owned by someone they did not know, as it was such a crucial waystop.</description>

      <description>Kareien was a skaa slave on Lord Devinshae's plantations in the Final Empire.

She was in a relationship with Dockson. Dockson had sneaked between skaa hovels to spend time with her, and other skaa protected them from the taskmasters, as Dockson was not to be out after dark. He had braved the mists for her. Kareien and Dockson's relationship gave hope to the skaa at the Devinshae plantation, and helped them get over their superstition of the mists.

One night, Kareien was taken by Devinshae, and, as the law required of a noble, she was killed (to not create half-breed Allomancers, and her corpse was buried the next morning. Dockson was destroyed inside, and left the same day she was buried, as he couldn't continue to be around Kareien's family and Devinshae.</description>

      <description>Ilamar was the cavalrylord for Highprince Dalinar Kholin's army.

Ilamar was an Alethi man, however his dark hair had a few red patches, and he had a long red moustache, implying some Veden or Unkalaki heritage as well. He also wore a long red mustache. Ilamar had a squat but compact frame.

In Gavilar Kholin's decisive battle against Highprince Kalanor, Ilamar and his group of fifty cavalrymen were armed with hooks and ropes for attacking enemy Shardbearers.

Ilamar notifies Dalinar that the cavalry was ready before heading into the Shattered Plains, but Torol Sadeas delays the excursion, demanding to enter the Kholin warcamp to investigate an assassination attempt on the king.

Dalinar confers with Ilamar and Teleb before assaulting the Tower, as Sadeas approaches to discuss tactics.

He died during the Battle of the Tower, along with Havar, Perethom and six thousand more members of Kholin army.</description>

- Khav's opinion of Kaladin

Khav is a resident of Hearthstone on Roshar.

He has low eyebrows and a permanently scowling expression. He is a teenager in, but younger than Jost's 14.

Kaladin uses his name as an example of a 'solid, Alethi darkeyes' names, unlike his own.

He was amongst the children including Jost, Jest, Mord, Tift, & Naget, who Kal and Laral approach one day and Kal asks if they should be worming. He doesn't believe Kal is a real darkeyes, nor does he agree that farmers and soldiers are equal professions.</description>

      <description>Jest is a darkeyed man from Hearthstone in Alethkar on Roshar who grew up with Kaladin.

Jest was born into a typical Hearthstone family of the fourth or fifth nahn. His parents are farmers, and his father spent time as a soldier. He is of the Vorin faith and refers to the ardents' teachings that men must become warriors to fight for the Tranquiline Halls. Kaladin cites Jest's name as an example of a 'solid, Alethi darkeyes' names, unlike his own.

As a child, Jest worked in the lavis fields outside of Hearthstone with the other darkeyed children of the village, helping to keep the polyps free of diggerworms. When they were not working, Jest played with the other children in the village, including his brother Jost, Tift, Mord, Naget, and Khav. Jest and the other children were bitter that Kaladin was able able to stay inside during the day, not realizing that he worked hard at his studies all day long.

In, Jest observed a fight between Kaladin and Jost.</description>

Inkima is a plump woman with yellow eyes and hair that she dyed black, indicating that she is likely not of pure Alethi blood. The color red did not suit Inkima, in Adolin's opinion. She has a tinkling laugh that Adolin found obnoxious. Inkima seems to be quite taken with Jakamav, laughing at everything he said.</description>

He was acquainted with Nohadon, and was Dalinar's host in one of visions. He was a man of letters, though he lost his right arm at some point before the vision. It seemed Nohadon was comfortable with Karm talking casually with him at the time of the vision.

When Dalinar brings Venli into the same vision, she plays the role of Karm, but has a Parshendi appearance. Dalinar then distracts Nohadon in order to talk to Venli.</description>

      <description>The Ironsights is a coastal exploration ship from Scadrial.

An unusual story about the ship is reported on by the Elendel Daily in 341. Around the year 339, the Ironsights was blown out to sea by a storm. It was presumed lost at sea and the families of the sailors believed that they were dead.

According to the broadsheet, after the ship's crew realized that they had lost their bearings, they sailed east hoping to find any type of land mass. Eventually, they found an island full of strange animals. On the island was a castaway who told stories of how his ship had been taken by a "strange seafaring people" who had unknown metals. The Ironsights finally managed to return to the Elendel Basin two years after it departed, in 341, with the castaway on board. The veracity of the account is uncertain, but the reference to unknown metals implies that the people who took the castaway's ship may have been the Southern Scadrians.</description>

      <description>Kale Tekiel is a noble in the Final Empire on Scadrial, shortly before the Collapse.

After House Tekiel's reputation and finances were destroyed in the house war, Tekiel tried to leave Luthadel, but the show of weakness was too much for other Luthadel nobility. Some of Tekiel's leadership was assassinated, and the rest had been killed on their canal boats, which were set on fire. This was the work of House Hasting.

Kale was implied to be one of the Tekiel nobles who were murdered. Telden Hasting said to Elend Venture that the house war would be no big deal, and that soon everyone would look back and wonder what the fuss was about, but Elend knew the stakes were higher, and Kale certainly wouldn't be able look back, since he was killed with the other Tekiels.</description>

      <description>"In short, if any presume Kazilah to be innocent, you must look at the facts and deny them in their entirety; to say that the Radiants were destitute of integrity for this execution of one their own, one who had obviously fraternized with the unwholesome elements, indicates the most slothful of reasoning; for the enemy’s baleful influence demanded vigilance on all occasions, of war and of peace."

- From Words of Radiance, chapter 32, page 17

Kazilah is a historical figure and possible member of the Knights Radiant mentioned in Words of Radiance. They were found to be guilty of fraternizing with "unwholesome elements," possibly some sort of agent of Odium.</description>

They are similarly sized to axehounds, and look like a combination of a crab and a tortoise. They do not live in the Shattered Plains.

According to Kaladin, the male kurl watches over their eggs.

Shallan mentions seeing a man with a trained kurl who will dance and wave its arms for fish.</description>

      <description>Kabers is a card game on Roshar that involves wagering.

Yalb played kabers with four guards outside of the Palanaeum in Kharbranth while waiting for Shallan Davar to finish her meeting with Jasnah Kholin. He won around eighty chips of various gemstones from the guards by cheating, despite the fact that they were watching him with suspicion.

"[Cheating's] what they right expected from me. Watched me like handlers of poisonous skyeels, they did. The game wasn't about the cards&mdash;it was about them trying to figure how I was cheating and me trying to figure how to keep them from hauling me off. I think I might not have managed to walk away with my skin if you hadn't arrived!"

      <description>Ivy is one of Stephen Leeds' earliest aspects.

She is in her early forties and has blonde hair. She is a psychiatrist, and appeared to generally do Stephen's thinking. She often makes connections and assumptions about people's characters and motives, and will feed Stephen lines during interrogations. Stephen often relies heavily on her advise and help, and when in Legion: Skin Deep she is not present to help him, he finds himself expecting her input. She is trypophobic, although she "mostly has it under control," and dislikes any swearing, even words such as 'damn' or 'hell.'

Ivy also has a strong love/hate relationship with J.C.. Apparently, this is the first time that two of Stephen's aspects have ever been in such a relationship.</description>

In 2211, a piece of carapace, presumed to be from the recently-missing Varvax ambassador, is found in a burning station on Evensong, and Harris is one of the officers investigating the incident under Captain Orson Ansed; at that point, Ansed considers him a "new kid." He leads Ansed into the building, shows him the burned piece of carapace, and reports that the sensor net recorded nothing. He also notes that the burners are emptied only once a month and that, if the body had been in there any longer, there probably would not have been any traces left. Finally, he informs Ansed that the worker who found the carapace already told the media.</description>

 * Infinity Blade: Awakening - Released Oct 2011 alongside the iPhone 4S announcement
 * Infinity Blade: Redemption - Released Sept 2013

The game developers were introduced to Brandon through Isaac, one of the art developers, as they were in college together. They approached him with the idea to write some stories set in the world of their games and Brandon accepted, partially because they were friends and partially so that he could gain experience writing for video games. He helped them develop a narrative that is much clearer in the later games, as well as a protagonist in the name of Siris.</description>

The underground city is massive, having multiple layers and being home to many of the lower class people. However, the conditions in the tunnels caused the Diggers to go crazy. Some of the tunnels have strange designs and is a labyrinth. Rooms carved out mid-steel with no way to enter have even been found by the Reckoners.</description>

      <description>Krell are a species of animal found on the island of Patji on First of the Sun.

The krell's appearance is unknown. Their natural predators include nightmaws, which hunt them on land, and deepwalkers that attack them when they are near the shore. The creatures are likely herbivorous, feeding on oceanside weeds.

The krell live together in herds and travel across the island on trails that they wear through the jungle. They often sleep beneath the roosts of Aviar in order to hide their minds from predators, since many Aviar provide mental protection. However, some of their predators have learned that if they startle the Aviar away from their nests, they can again sense the minds of the krell.</description>

He was skilled in chemistry and had died prior to the search for Razon's camera, removing Stephen and his aspects' ability to know about chemistry in any significant detail. His death did not, however, remove Stephen's knowledge of biotech companies, despite Stephen's assumption that it would.

Justin has also disappeared, presumably dying in a similar manner to Ignacio.</description>

She also may make Indian curries for the other aspects, or encourage them to try them, as J.C. mentions her making one for them (which he assumes is Chinese food, since it has rice in it).

      <description>Kelsier's bones are the physical remains of Kelsier. They were utilized by the kandra OreSeur and TenSoon on at least two separate occasions.

On the first occasion, OreSeur consumes them in order to inspire the skaa to rebel against the Lord Ruler as the conclusion of Kelsier's plan to bring down the Final Empire.

Later, they are used by TenSoon to save remnants of the population in Luthadel from a Ruin-influenced Penrod. The bones were eventually brought to the Kandra Homeland.

The remains survived Harmony's ascension.</description>

The Knighthawk Foundry also experiments and develops other Epic-based technologies, using Epic DNA harvested by the Reckoners. One of the devices they developed was the spyril.

Knighthawk is generally regarded as a safe, trustworthy mobile network. But in fact, Dean is able to read and write any message on his phones.</description>

- Kai to Sophie

Kairominas is the Liveborn ruler of Alornia, his home State. Having united all of Alornia on his 300th birthday, Kai's youth was exciting and adventure filled. The fifty years following the unification of Alornia threatened to bore Kai, though he developed a nemesis in a neighboring Liveborn called Melhi. Melhi and Kai have since skirmished in Border States between their two States, as well as within Alornia.

Around his 350th birthday, Kai is contacted by the Wode, asking him to travel to a Communal State, meet with a woman, and procreate. While in the Communal State Kai partakes in an insightful discussion with his date, Sophie, and manages to defeat a giant robot sent by Melhi. Kai also learns that Sophie is one of Melhi's robots as well, and returns to Alornia with a longing to learn about other Liveborn rather than continuing to follow the preplanned path for his home State.</description>

Jasmine is a Liveborn that plays in the game of paintball on Maltese. She and an ally were under attack by another faction in the game, her ally having been shot already. Kai attempts to save her, but she believes his rescue is a ruse by her attackers, and she opens fire on Kai. She misses, however, and Kai shoots her in response. She is incredibly annoyed that someone who was factionless hit her, and laments that this will severely damage her rankings.</description>

The buildings are mentioned as being very 'creative-friendly,' with brightly coloured walls, beanbag seats, arcade games, a free cafeteria and food stations, and even a tire swing. There are also lego bricks placed on the tables in conference rooms to give the engineers something to do with their hands during meetings. It is seen to be like a pre-school to some.</description>

On Roshar, the King's Boon is a privilege that can be granted to a lighteyes who has performed an impressive feat before the King of Alethkar, such as winning a difficult duel. The limit of what the boon can grant is unknown, though it presumably must adhere to existing laws and traditions, meaning that a darkeyes cannot demand it or use it to challenge a lighteyes. If a boon is granted that affects another subject of the king, that person must obey it as well.</description>

      <description>Idashwy is a Terris Steelrunner. Bleeder kills her and steals her ability to use Feruchemical steel.

Idashwy grew up in the Village but would often sneak out in her youth. Wax remembers her as a shy girl with golden hair. She moved into the Bournton District and got a job as a bookkeeper for a jeweler near her apartment. According to Vwafendal, she vanished about a month before Lady ZoBell's party and had been behaving erratically and claiming that she was being visited by her dead brother's spirit. She was last seen at work over a week before the party, and no one answered when her employer sent someone to her flat. Wax found her corpse in the kitchen of her apartment and recognized her wound as one caused by a Hemalurgic spike from the description in the book Ironeyes had sent him.</description>

      <description>Lady ZoBell's Party is an event that takes place in ZoBell Tower in Elendel.

This is the first party held in the penthouse of ZoBell Tower and was planned around the governor’s spring dinner and policy speech. Invitations were sent to the upper crust of the society, both in Elendel and beyond.

As Steris predicts, the coach attendants at the entrance of the tower were not properly prepared to handle all of the traffic and it backs up significantly. This is complicated by increased security due to the assassination attempt on the governor earlier that day. As a result they are turning away anyone who is not specifically on the guest list, even if they have procured an invitation.

Wayne and Marasi both end up on the list of people who are not to be let in under any circumstances. Wayne uses a time bubble to sneakily examine the guest list and determines that he should impersonate Professor Hanlanaze. Marasi aids him in this disguise.

While Wax and Steris are talking to Governor Innate, Bleeder begins to talk mentally to Wax. The conversation includes a threat to Wax's father, who Wax takes to mean Steris's father. After carefully studying the movements of everyone else in the room, Wax concludes that Bleeder is impersonating a particular waiter. There is a scuffle in which Wayne tackles the waiter and is dog-piled by the governor's guards. The waiter escapes in the confusion and Wax spots him near a window. Bleeder tries to distract Wax by mentioning Lessie, but Wax shoots at the waiter anyway and misses, hitting a window instead. The waiter smashes the window and leaps out. Wax follows.</description>

      <description>Lady Kelesina Shores was a noble resident of New Seran. She was a collaborator with the Set.

She threw a party which was attended by Waxillium Ladrian and Steris Harms. During the party Wax baited Kelesina into revealing her connection to the Set. He told her he possessed a mysterious coin and knew of some happenings northeast of New Seran. He judged her reaction to this news as alarmed. She fled the party and contacted Mister Suit through a metal box that emitted Suit's voice. When Wax confronted her after learning she was responsible for the Nightstreet Gang's attack on their train, she was shot in the forehead by her Brute maid.

Hoid often sneaks onto the grounds of her mansion and has at least a somewhat reasonable claim that he actually owns it.</description>

- Kelsier's thoughts in the Cognitive Realm

Ishathon is a mythical location spoken of in stories on Scadrial. The myth is Scadrial-specific.

There was said to be a great maze at Ishathon, and in stories a string was used to find the way out.

When the Cognitive shadow of Kelsier followed a thread of Preservation's essence to meet Khriss and Nazh on the island in the Cognitive Realm that corresponds to Lake Luthadel, he compared following Preservation to being guided by the mythical string from the maze of Ishathon.</description>

      <description>"Here on Dayside the sun is king. Ker'Reen Philosophy, the religion of Kerztians, calls the sun the manifestation of the Sand Lord, the source of man's autonomy and independence."

- Kenton

Ker'Reen Philosophy is the predominant religion of Kerzta.

The philosophy calls for worship of the sun, teaching that it is the manifestation of the Sand Lord and the source of autonomy and independence. The Ker'Reen Philosophy denounces the use of sand mastery as heresy, which has led to war between Kerzta and Lossand in the past.

The priest DaiKeen oversees the religion among Kerztians. They are led by the A'Kar, or high priest. Members of the priest DaiKeen are traditionally marked by square-shaped scars on their foreheads, though some have recently been found to wear X-shaped scars similar to the tattoos of the warrior DaiKeen. Members of the clergy speak Karshad.

The KerKor is the primary religious text of the Ker'Reen religion.</description>

- 'May the Sand Lord bless us!' in Karshad

Karshad is a holy language spoken by members of the Priest DaiKeen, the Kerztian clergy on Taldain.

When Khriss first arrived on Dayside, she and Cynder recognized Karshad as the language being spoken by a zealous man at a rally of Kerztian warriors. They later learned that the man was the A'Kar, presumably inciting the warriors on their way to attack the Diem.</description>

      <description>Kenton's mother is a woman from the Darkside of Taldain.

She marries a Daysider, a powerful sand master named Praxton, and gives birth to a number of children, including Kenton. The marriage between a sand master and a Darksider broke with tradition. The couple's children lacked natural talent for sand mastery, with only Kenton attempting to join the Diem; it was rumored that this was due to the Darksider ethnicity polluting the family tree.

Kenton learned to speak Dynastic from his mother, as it was her native tongue. After the attack on the Diem, Kenton notes that it has been two years since he has heard someone speak Dynastic, implying that his mother died or otherwise lost contact with him at that time.</description>

      <description>"No, they were always one. And always apart. Very odd, very complex."

- Allik Neverfar

The Jaggenmire is an entity worshiped in Southern Scadrian religion. It consists of two entities that are always both separate and the same. It is made up of Herr (Ruin), and his sister/wife Frue (Preservation). Herr can make things go, and Frue can make things stop. However, neither can create life on their own.

It is believed by the Southern Scadrians that their former Kings, now called the Fallen, offended the Jaggenmire, which caused the event known to Southern Scadrians as the Ice Death.</description>

      <description>Laran is a messenger in Kholin army turned Windrunner of Bridge Four.

At some point in Laran's past she joined the Kholin army as a messenger. She was quite able in this role; some believed her to be the fastest of the messengers.

She likely tried out for Bridge Four with Lyn and the other female scouts and messengers from House Kholin at Narak in 1174, and may have learned to draw in Stormlight then. After the discovery of the attack on the Bridge Four barracks in Urithiru during the Battle of Thaylen Field, Lyn tasked Laran with running to the guard post and fetching Renarin to heal the wounded. After the battle itself, Lopen told Laran and Lyn an exagerated version of the story of how he lost his arm.

In the following year, Laran bonded one of the honorspren that had chosen to help refound the Windrunners and swore her first two Ideals. She accompanied the Fourth Bridge during its evacuation of Hearthstone and fought the shanay-im that confronted them there. Towards the end of the battle, she swore her Third Ideal and her spren manifest as a Blade for the first time. As with many Windrunners, the third ideal was difficult for Laran. Following the battle, she presented her spren to Kaladin in Blade form and he congratulated the pair on their accomplishment.</description>

Grund knew of Jom, and suggested to Veil that Jom would be a good candidate to give extra food to, along with many other candidates. However, the Grips killed all of Grund's friends for the food and terrorized anyone who received food, so it is possible Jom is now dead.</description>

Jerono is an officer in a Herdazian army on Roshar.

He was present when his general, Dieno enne Calah, interrogated Sheler near the border of Herdaz and Alethkar. Dieno had a hobby of escaping from manacles while his officers made bets on how long it would take him to escape. Jerono provided some supposedly high-quality manacles of Thaylen design, but Dieno quickly escaped anyway, surprising Jerono.</description>

He is referred to as a striker. When Dalinar and the elites approached Brightlord Yezriar, Jenin unhooked his shortbow and shot Yezriar's horse. Jenin lamented that it was a terrible waste of money, and Dalinar said he would buy Jenin two horses when they were finished.</description>

      <description>Kai-garnis is a thunderclast involved in the Battle of Thaylen Field.

She awakened from the bay in the midst of the singer army before the battle by sinking into the stone and becoming it, before ripping herself out of the ground. Odium later complimented her on the destruction of part of the outer wall and tasked her with taking the Oathgate if the Tisark couldn't destroy it. Hrdalm and Adolin Kholin attacked her, but were unable to do serious damage. When Renarin Kholin arrived, however, Kai-garnis appeared to be scared of him. Renarin convinced Adolin to stand down, as he did not have his Shardplate at the time, so Adolin lent Maya to Hrdlam; Renarin and Hrdlam then continued the attack and managed to cut off Kai-garnis' legs and arms. Once she was immobilized, Renarin approached and drew in a large amount of Stormlight, which caused Kai-garnis to flee from the stone.</description>

The Azish are stunned by Jasnah's eloquence; among other impressive writing techniques, she analyzes a single quote from Prime Kasimarlix in three different stages, "each escalating the same quote to a different level of Superior Understanding". The reason for Kasimarlix's status as "Prime" is not clear; they may have been a Prime Aqasix, but Prime is also used in other contexts in the region, such as Prime Kadasix and the Prime of Emul.</description>

      <description>Brightlord Kaves Kholin is a distant Kholin relative that lives in Kholinar during the Era of Solitude.

During his time as a lesser lord in Kholinar, Kaves wielded only middling power. However he had greater ambitions and often sought to increase his influence within the city, much to the annoyance of the royal members of his family. As such there was little love lost between Kaves and the main branch of House Kholin.

Following the arrival of the True Desolation and the besieging of Kholinar by the Voidbringers, Kaves Kholin like many other lighteyes sought an audience with Queen Aesudan, who had retreated into her palace and not been seen for some time. He came to the palace accompanied by several attendants, but was captured and executed on the queen's orders along with his retainers. His corpse, as well as those of his attendants, were placed in a wine cellar within the palace and allowed to rot and be scavenged by cremlings. The bodies were discovered by Shallan Davar during her attempt to infiltrate the palace. She brought this news back Adolin and Elhokar, who guessed one of the corpses likely belonged to Kaves, but mourned little for his death.</description>

They are presumably Alethi and lighteyed, as they were put in charge of organizing the guards in Paladar's tents and were responsible for placing Guff on guard duty. After Guff brought Moash to see the Brightlord and Moash did not respond to questioning, Paladar had Guff beaten and ordered Ked to post a new guard. Paladar threatened Ked with a beating if Guff's replacement also proved incompetent.

It is unclear if Ked was a guard, or if they were just in charge of their organization.</description>

After her child is killed, Kheni goes into a catatonic state, staring blankly while holding onto an empty cradle. Though she may seem to not be aware of her surroundings, often remaining silent when spoken to and giving no visual signs of understanding, she does listen to those who speak to her. Her condition worries her husband greatly and he will often hover close to his wife.

Hoid befriends the couple while spending time disguised among the many humans held captive in Kholinar by the Fused and other singers. He visits Kheni before departing the city, suggesting different bodily alterations he could give himself to try and provoke a reaction from the women. Hoid finds a young girl who has been orphaned and brings her to Kheni and Cob so that they can take care of her, which seems to cause Kheni to begin to regain her senses.</description>

Kmakra is a child mentioned in one of the records in the Urithiru gem archive. It seems likely that Kmakra was ethnically Thaylen due to their name, or part-Thaylen.

Their mother was planning to depart Urithiru and was given the opportunity to leave a message. She chose to leave a record of her family. A ruby was used to record the message, so she was likely a Dustbringer.

She felt Kmakra, as well as Kmakra's sibling Molinar, were the true gemstones of her life.</description>

      <description>Initiation is the process by which a person is chosen to gain the ability to access a manifestation of Investiture (and/or the process of actually gaining such access). Shardholders can choose to alter how Initiation for their Shard's magic works to some extent, subject to some limitations determined by the underlying mechanics. The method of Initiation varies between different manifestations, but there are cosmere-wide principles underlying the different methods: in order for a person to be Initiated, it is generally necessary for their soul to have some degree of "damage", creating cracks in their Spiritweb that Investiture can rush into and fill, thereby linking them to the magic. Some magic systems make it much easier than others to achieve this.</description>

Glorious Rises of Industry is a suburb in Igneous. It is where Spensa, her mother, and Gran-Gran live. It is also the home of Rig.

Igneous has a starship museum that celebrates warriors of the past. The museum has mock cockpits which patrons can sit in to experience what it would be like to be in a starfighter.

The public elevators that can take people and cargo to the surface can be found near the center of Igneous. The government buildings are close to the elevators and are used to host the pilots entrance test. One can elect to take the pilot entry exam when they are seventeen. The test goes for four hours and can cover material from any number of classes taken by students.</description>

Kimmalyn initially chose the callsign Quick, however, she changed it to Quirk after it was misremembered by multiple members of her flight.

Although she initially quit the DDF flight program after the death of Hurl, Kimmalyn is reinstated as a full pilot following the Battle of Alta Second.</description>

      <description>"I'm not sure I'd wish this command on [the pilots I used to fly with]. Not even the ones I hated."

- Admiral Judy "Ironsides" Ivans on her position as the head of the DDF

Judy Ivans (Callsign: Ironsides) was the Admiral of the Fleet of the Defiant Defense Force until after the Battle of Alta Second. She fought in the Battle of Alta, making her a First Citizen. After Chaser's actions during the Battle of Alta, she became terrified of another person with the "defect" (the brain condition that grants access to Cytonic abilities) becoming a pilot and does everything in her power to prevent that from happening. To that end, she tries to keep Spensa out of Flight School, but does not have the authority to stop Cobb from adding her to his class. However, in an effort to make life so difficult that Spensa gives up and quits, she issues an order barring Spensa from using any of the Flight School's facilities, including the mess hall and dormitories.

She is continually frustrated by the National Assembly Leaders denial of the existence of the defect, removal of their children—some of the top pilots—from the DDF, and refusal to send up their private ships to aid the DDF during Krell attacks. Over time, the number of acclivity rings and pilots available to the DDF has dwindled, leaving her increasingly desperate to fend off the Krell. As a result, she approves a desperate mission to retrieve half of a C-137-KJM orbital shipyard with hundreds of acclivity rings. That plan nearly resulted in the Krell destroying Alta Base and Igneous Cavern; that near-defeat may have been a factor in her "reluctant" retirement.</description>

      <description>Dr. Iglom is a doctor in the Defiant Defense Force.

She is involved in studying Spensa's brainwaves. Though Dr. Iglom's colleague, Dr. Halbeth, believes that the increase in activity in the Writellum section of Spensa's brain when interacting with the Krell is proof of the defect, Dr. Iglom is less willing to draw conclusions off data from a single event. Ironsides tasks Rikolfr with trying to encourage Dr. Iglom to strongly support the defects existence, particularly in relation to Spensa. In doing so, Ironsides would consider Dr. Iglom to have done her a personal favor.</description>

      <description>A lifebuster is an explosive weapon of mass destruction used by the Krell to subdue the human population of Detritus.

Lifebuster bombs explode in three stages. The first wave is a downward blast that penetrates rock, exposing caverns underneath it. The second one consists of a strange greenish-black corrosion that causes a chain reaction in organic matter and exterminates life. The third explosion is a shock wave meant to further spread the "terrible burning green light" of the second stage to places where it may kill more living things.</description>

      <description>Callsign Jager is a member of Nightmare Flight along with Nose, Tunestone, Sushi, Bog, and Nord..

They graduated Flight School in the previous class to Skyward Flight.

Jorgen Weight hoped to use it as his own callsign until finding out that it was in use.

During their training, Skyward Flight was paired with Nightmare Flight, however, Jager was not present during this exercise. The flightleader, Nose, offered Spensa and FM spots on Nightmare Flight as they were down several members, suggesting that Jager may have died.</description>

      <description>"The warrior cannot choose her bed; she must bless the stars if she can choose her battlefield."

- A quote from Junmi’s, The Conquest of Space.

Junmi is the author of The Conquest of Space. As Spensa was told stories about Junmi by her grandmother while growing up, it is likely that this book is autobiographical to at least some extent. If so, Junmi was a spacefarer involved in exploring and conquering, potentially violently, some amount of the universe. She held some sort of belief that people should be accepting and grateful for what they are given in life.

Spensa throughly enjoyed being told stories about Junmi while she was growing up and believes that she liked these stories almost as much as she liked stories about the Vikings. Stories of Junmi contain fewer decapitations than stories of the Vikings.</description>

      <description>Jenny Zhang is one of Stephen Leeds's aspects. She's a tall, mature Asian woman with a square face and prominent smile lines.

She was created unknowingly by Stephen at the beginning of his search for Sandra. Before Stephen realizes that she's an aspect, he says that she is a reporter and writer who writes almost voyeuristic pop biographies. After Stephen realizes that she is an aspect, she has a difficult time following the rules, frequently appearing from nowhere. She claims to be a biographer aspect, and Stephen assumes she's writing about him. However, after his aspects disappear, she reveals that she's actually creating biographies of his aspects. These biographies allow him to remember the dead aspects and write about them.</description>

Khriss and Baon discuss Skathan, the current monarch of the Dynasty; it is implied that Skathan is from Iiaria and that Iiaria is part of the Dynasty. Skathan has several magical abilities, but they do not appear to be common to other Iiarians.</description>

      <description>"Sometimes I wonder if the Lifebrother himself sent you to me."

- Taravangian to Szeth

The Lifebrother is a god figure from Rosharan mythology that Taravangian references. Szeth indicates that he believes the Lifebrother to be Vorin, but no other Vorins have mentioned him, putting this in doubt. It seems clear, however, that the Lifebrother is not Shin.

Taravangian wonders if the Lifebrother sent Szeth to him. Why Taravangian associates the Lifebrother with his circumstances regarding Szeth is not clear. He seems to regard gaining a Truthless as a lucky event, especially since he speaks Szeth's native tongue. This means he could associate the Lifebrother with good fortune or something similar. Szeth seems to consider the Lifebrother's involvement to be related to the bloody nature of Szeth's work, indicating the Lifebrother may be a more bloodthirsty figure.</description>

Rats like eating kurdi mushrooms, which Spensa uses to her advantage while hunting, using them to lure the creatures into traps. They taste unpleasant.

As M-Bot likes to catalogue mushrooms it is possible that he has information on kurdi mushrooms in his database.

Spensa may have eaten kurdi mushrooms while she lived in M-Bot's cave during her time at Flight School.</description>

Drama is a cadet in either Inkwell Flight or Firestorm Flight. If she is part of Inkwell Flight then only four members remain in her Flight in the time period just before graduation. If she is not, then there are only two members of Inkwell Flight at this point in time.

Remark is also a cadet in either Inkwell Flight or Firestorm Flight.

Spensa and FM eat dinner with members of Inkwell and Firestorm Flight not long after Arturo is pulled from Flight School. During dinner, the three Flights discuss whether they would be combined into one larger Flight due to their reduced numbers and if so, which Flight name they would keep.</description>

Elorin uses KaDo to poison the bowl all of the sand masters drink from in the Kerla causing them to dehydrate quickly and be massacred when they were attacked by Kerztian warriors. Elorin also uses it to poison the bowl Drile drank from before his duel with Kenton in a plot to ensure a weak leader would rule the Diem. His plot succeeds and Kenton defeats the more powerful Drile. Afterwards Kenton realizes that something was wrong and confronts Elorin. Elorin confesses and in the ensuing fight Kenton kills him.</description>

      <description>Ico's father is a deadeye lightspren on Roshar. He was bonded to a Radiant before the Recreance, and was "killed", becoming a deadeye, when his Knight betrayed his oaths.

Ico refers to him as his father, but the nature of familial relationships among spren is not fully understood. Ico keeps him locked in the hold of his ship in Shadesmar to keep him from wandering off in an attempt to find the human that wields his Shardblade corpse in the Physical Realm. The fate of his father seems to have made Ico skeptical that a human such as Adolin could have any true regard for a deadeye spren such as Mayalaran.</description>

Ingo is a type of tea on Roshar.

Taravangian drinks it with mint and its smell reminds him of his home, Kharbranth. Maben served him a hot cup of the tea while they were in Urithiru discussing Dalinar's recovery; on this occasion, the reminder of home prompted Taravangian to ponder his mortality.</description>

      <description>"I'm Preservation. The knife ... I haven’t actually drawn it in millennia. You speak of acting like [Ruin], as he pretended I would act! It’s horrible!"

- Leras to Kelsier

Leras's knife is a knife of unknown origin that belongs to Leras. Its handle is made of bone.

Leras refers to the knife as an "old friend," and hasn't drawn it in millennia, which may suggest it is from Yolen and predates the Shattering of Adonalsium.

When Vin and Elend Venture arrived at the Well of Ascension, Kelsier suggested that Leras stab Elend with the knife to try to encourage Vin to use the power of the Well to heal Elend rather than accidentally release it to Ruin. When, as a result of Preservation's influence on his mind, Leras proved unable to do so, Kelsier grabed his arm and slashed the knife across Elend's stomach. Despite his inability to use the weapon, Leras still reached for it when Kelsier made a fist at him. Leras does not need to actually draw the knife; he instead reaches for it on his belt, after which his hand shimmers and then the knife appears.

It is unclear what happened to the knife after Leras's death. His body appeared in the ash outside Fadrex City; it is possible the knife was with that corpse. If that is the case, it may well be gone, as Sazed did not do anything with the bodies of Ati and Leras during his Ascension.</description>

- Ranette

Invarian steel is a metal alloy on Scadrial. It is silvery in color. Ranette uses it to make Vindication, her Allomancer specific handgun. It is stronger and lighter than ordinary steel. This allows her to increase the number of chambers in the cylinder without making the pistol too large.</description>

      <description>"Ignorance is hardly unusual, Miss Davar. The longer I live, the more I come to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind. There are many who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be impressed with their efforts."

- Jasnah to Shallan

"...a woman's mind is her most precious weapon. It must not be employed clumsily or prematurely. Much like the aforementioned knife to the back, a clever gibe is most effective when it is unanticipated."

- Jasnah to Shallan

"Youthful immaturity is one of the cosmere’s great catalysts for change... To be young is about action. To be a scholar is about informed action."

- Jasnah to Shallan

"Too many scholars think of research as purely a cerebral pursuit. If we do nothing with the knowledge we gain, then we have wasted our study. Books can store information better than we can&mdash;what we do that books cannot is interpret . So if one is not going to draw conclusions, then one might as well just leave the information in the texts."

- Jasnah to Shallan

"I always forgive curiosity, Your Majesty. It strikes me as one of the most genuine of emotions."

- Jasnah to Taravangian

"A true scholar must not close her mind on any topic, no matter how certain she may feel. Just because I have not yet found a convincing reason to join one of the devotaries does not mean I never will. Though each time I have a discussion like the one today, my convictions grow firmer."

- Jasnah to Shallan

"When we are young, we want simple answers. There is no greater indication of youth, perhaps, than the desire for everything to be as it should . As it has ever been. The older we grow, the more we question. We begin to ask why. And yet, we still want the answers to be simple. We assume that the people around us&mdash;adults, leaders&mdash;will have those answers. Whatever they give often satisfies us. ... Indeed, it seems to me that aging, wisdom, and wondering are synonymous. The older we grow, the more likely we are to reject the simple answers. Unless someone gets in our way and demands they be accepted regardless."

- Jasnah to Shallan

"You will find wise men in any religion, Shallan, and good men in every nation. Those who truly seek wisdom are those who will acknowledge the virtue in their adversaries and who will learn from those who disabuse them of error. All others&mdash;heretic, Vorin, Ysperist, or Maakian&mdash;are equally closed-minded."

- Jasnah to Shallan

"Let the Vorin believe as they wish&mdash;the wise among them will find goodness and solace in their faith; the fools would be fools no matter what they believed."

- Jasnah to Shallan

"Power is an illusion of perception...Some kinds of power are real -- power to command armies, power to soulcast. These come into play far less often than you would think."

- Jasnah to Shallan

"Most threats to a dynasty came from within."

      <description>Introspections is a Rosharan book written by Pleadix. The subject matter is implied to relate to the nature and observation of change in one's environment.

In a conversation with Rushu, Lopen comments that he can only be certain about a food tasting differently over time, rather than his own personal tastes having changed. He explains that the only thing he can truly know is that he is himself; thus, if he experiences a change, it must be due to a difference in his environment. On hearing this, Rushu asks whether he has ever had Introspections read to him, as he appears to be espousing Pleadix's ideology. Lopen indicates that he has not.</description>

      <description>Lezian, also known as The Pursuer, is a nex-im, or "Those Ones of Husks" Fused on Roshar. As a nex-im, Lezian has access to the Surge of Transportation. Lezian is named the Pursuer, due to his tradition of hunting down those that had previously killed him and claiming their life. This tradition was started to avoid the shame of being the first Fused to be killed by a human. He was so dedicated to this that he would even kill himself once the Heralds returned to Braize so that he couldn't be killed by a human he couldn't later Pursue. Leshwi notes that while he is respected for his determination, he is also reckless, having endangered plans and ruined many missions.

During the True Desolation, Lezian first appeared in Hearthstone on the mission to test the Fourth Bridge's battle potential. Kaladin came to the town before the ship, and had been spotted. Lezian came searching, and eventually found Kaladin in disguise. The two fought, and eventually Lezian retreated, warning Kaladin to watch for him. Later, the Pursuer reappears and Kaladin confronts him. He then used a Voidlight fabrial that suppressed Kaladin's powers. Lezian laughs and says that Kaladin relies too much on his powers in combat, but Kaladin attacks anyway, and kills the Pursuer, becoming Lezian's next target. Kaladin fought the Pursurer multiple times during Raboniel's occupation of Urithiru, ultimately killing him again just prior to the restoration of the Sibling and naming him "Defeated One". When Lezian returns after this death, El annihilates him with a dagger charged with anti-Voidlight in order to test whether the inverse Light functions as Raboniel theorized. It does, and Lezian permanently dies.</description>

There are several situations for which this long, curved, easy-to-draw sword would be a good choice: when fighting against an unarmored opponent, when doing horseback charges that take one past one's opponent, and when a fight or fighting style calls for heavy use of slicing and cutting.</description>

Feruchemists can use nicrosil to store Investiture, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, nicrosil steals Investiture. While the exact composition of Allomantic or Feruchemical nicrosil is unknown, real-world nicrosil is an alloy primarily of nickel, with some chromium and a small amount of silicon.</description>

She was born in Idris, but left to live in Hallandren during her teenage years, eventually becoming a reputable courtesan in T'Telir. She gave her Breath to a customer with whom she had fallen in love, and he left her afterwards. When she was a Drab, she began to have more trouble finding work, being eventually forced to run a poor whorehouse, while using old contacts to acquire clients. Once she had earned enough money, she bought another Breath and left to go back to Idris, becoming a cook in the kitchens.

She is Siri's friend and maternal figure. She takes a traditional view on religion, gently chiding Siri for being excessively ostentatious in her spontaneity. According to Siri, she has a tendency to fret, and a wisdom to her which goes beyond her cooking abilities.</description>

      <description>The Metallic Arts are the three prime manifestations of Investiture on Scadrial. They consist of Allomancy, Feruchemy, and Hemalurgy. All three utilize certain metal alloys and each manifest specific abilities in the user (namely, metal is not the source of their power, but metal is their focus). There are eight basic metals, each with an alloy, for a total of sixteen metals. In addition, there are God Metals, and alloys of them.</description>

- Av

The Old Magic is a manifestation of Investiture on Roshar. A person can gain a single unique ability from the Old Magic, but are also given a unique curse along with their boon, which may or may not be related. The Old Magic predates spren bonds.</description>

      <description>The Nightwatcher was a remnant of the Old Magic that was the prevalent religion across Roshar before the rise of Vorinism. She is a Splinter of Cultivation.

The Nightwatcher would bless those who sought her out with one blessing of her choosing. In exchange for this blessing, she also bestows a single curse, although this curse very rarely has any obvious relation to the blessing that was gained. Because of the Nightwatcher's ethereal nature and ties to a single location, the Valley, she is considered by many to be a powerful spren. It is surprisingly common for devoutly Vorin lighteyes go to the Nightwatcher at one point or another over the course of their lives.

She does not always appear to those seeking her, having a tendency to avoid groups and likely "foreigners" like Felt (worldhoppers). Supposedly, the best time of day to visit the Nightwatcher is right after the sun sets.</description>

      <description>"It was hatred. A deep, pulsing hatred with a pressure to turn all things molten. It was the heat of a thousand suns, it was the bliss of every kiss, it was the lives of all men wrapped up in one, defined by everything they felt."

- Dalinar describing Odium

Odium is the Shard of Adonalsium. Unlike most other Shards, which typically pick a single world and settle there, Odium has been traveling freely throughout the cosmere for a long time, deliberately refusing to Invest himself anywhere. He is responsible for the deaths of at least four Shards -- Ambition, Devotion, Dominion, and Honor. In the present, he's confined to the planet Braize, but his influence can be felt on the entire Rosharan system. Odium’s Investiture is typically associated with “burning” gold or violet-black colors, though it is also often red, the color that signifies corrupted Investiture. His overall motif is red-gold, although gold is his "real" color.</description>

      <description>The mistfallen were a group of Seers, or atium mistings during the last stages of the New Empire on Scadrial.

As Ruin gained control and attempted to destroy all life on Scadrial, Preservation's plan to thwart him was triggered. The Mists, which are manifestation of his power, lashed out at seemingly random individuals, raising people's Allomantic potential and snapping them with the side effect of falling ill for a short time. Due to Ruin's intervention, the mists became more violent, killing the weaker ones in the process. Noorden, Elend's scribe, discovers that exactly 16 percent of any group of people that fall to the mists become sick, whether they be villagers, soldiers, etc. Sixteen matched the known number of allomantic metals -- the exact percentage was a clue from Preservation that those who were struck were snapped) into mistings. Preservation chose to leave the clue this way so that even Ruin cannot alter it.

Some of the soldiers "attacked" by the mists in Elend's army were sick for 16 days rather than a few days. They were also exactly 1/16th of those who were struck. Others in the army consider them to be cursed because they took longer to recover. Multiple fights break out between them and the mistfallen, a name they presumably took upon themselves. Even General Demoux is attacked by a soldier, Bilg, causing the soldier's execution. Elend finally decides to separate them from the main army, sending them away on the pretext of helping out the apparently dire situation in Luthadel.

Later, when Elend meets the mistfallen company in the Pits of Hathsin, where the wealth of atium is hidden away from Ruin, he realizes that they were sick longer because they are the most powerful type of misting: atium mistings. Such mistings were not known to exist until Elend learned of Aradan Yomen's example. Demoux and his men fought the attacking Koloss with atium Allomancy in order to buy Elend time and burn away Ruin's body.</description>

The straits are lined by tall, sleek lighthouses for navigation. Various creatures live in the water, including santhidyn, khornaks, redwaters, and schools of small fish. The straits become narrow near Klna City, but in some areas they are wide enough that it can be difficult to see land.</description>

It is most well known as the trilogy of Mistborn: The Final Empire, The Well of Ascension and The Hero of Ages, but there have been additional installments. Brandon originally planned a "trilogy of trilogies" but this has been expanded into a number of series over various eras in the history of Scadrial.</description>

When giving command of the crew to Milev, Kelsier demands Camon be made a beggar. Vin assumes Milev will simply have Camon killed, but it is later proven that Milev's fear and/or awe of Kelsier was enough for him to follow through in his promise.

Milev was slowly tortured to death by Steel Inquisitors for information on Vin's whereabouts. They tied him to a chair and gouged out his eyes while questioning him.</description>

      <description>Nightblood is the working title for the sequel to Warbreaker. It is currently on hold, and probably the cosmere book most in jeopardy of not being written. It definitely will not be written until Stormlight Archive 5 and Mistborn Era 2 are done, and may have to wait for the Elantris trilogy, Mistborn Era 3, and possibly Stormlight Archive 6 to be written, as those projects are consuming much of Brandon's time.

At one point, Brandon was planning on publicly releasing drafts as he wrote, as he did with Warbreaker, though it is unclear if that is still the case.

It will not feature all the characters from Warbreaker; the original plan was to center the story on Vasher, Vivenna, Nightblood and further develop their characters. Characters like Susebron and Siri may get some updates, but would not be the focus of the book. Brandon also plans to introduce new characters; a recent outline also includes a married couple that, for political reasons, acts like they hate each other.

The book would focus heavily on story of the Five Scholars, including how Vasher became cosmere aware and travelled to Roshar, as well as his history with Denth. Vasher and Vivenna would be attempting to stop Yesteel, who recently learned how to create Awakened Shardblades and attempted to start a second Manywar. Jewels and Clod might join him, while Tonk Fah could feature, but would likely go in his own direction.

There are several questions about Nalthis and its magic that Brandon has mentioned addressing in the book, including the origin of the Idrian royal family, how other regions of Nalthis interact with Returned, and how Vasher suppressed his divine Breath.

Chronologically, it should be the cosmere book that immediately precedes The Way of Kings and should help explain how Nightblood got to Roshar, though Vasher's arrival on Roshar will occur between this book and The Way of Kings.</description>

      <description>Mythwalker is the ninth novel Brandon ever wrote, though it was unfinished. Elements of it were cannibalized for the Mistborn sequence, The Way of Kings, and Warbreaker, including the characters Vivenna and Siri, who became two of Warbreaker's main characters. It's sometimes referred to as Warbreaker Prime.

Brandon claims Mythwalker is the only book he has ever given up writing. All Brandon wrote of it has been posted online at his blog, along with commentary by Brandon's assistant, Peter Ahlstrom. According to Peter, Mythwalker and its magic system contributed to the creation of Sanderson's Second Law.</description>

Miles Dagouter, also known as Miles Hundredlives, was the former lawman of True Madil in the Roughs of Scadrial and leader of the gang of thieves and kidnappers known as the Vanishers. Miles was determined to bring the government of the Elendel to its knees in his quest to get justice for its perceived mistreatment of the people of the Roughs.</description>

      <description>"'It's colored and constructed to hide you in the mist,' Kelsier said. 'And it warns city guards and other Mistborn not to bother you.' He spun, letting the cloak ﬂare dramatically. 'I think it suits me.'"

- Kelsier

A mistcloak is the cloak worn by Mistborn while traveling through the mists in order to obscure their figure and so prevent them from being seen. It is a hooded garment made from a lightweight material, and consisted of ribbonlike strips of dark gray cloth sewn together at the shoulders and chest. Mistcloaks are constructed to come free when pulled, so that they cannot be used against the wearer in combat.

"A mistcloak would be hard to get right. I've seen several people try, and they never quite feel right to me. Maybe they are one of those things that work in my imagination, but might not work in the real world.What I would be looking for is something enveloping, something grand, yet also much more light-weight than most of the ones that people have made.  I know that Vin describes hers as heavy, but that's all relative.

But here's my best answer to your questions:

Colors: All the same shade of dark, charcoal gray. How wide are the strips: Between a half an inch and an inch wide. Material: Cotton, perhaps. Lighter than canvas or wool, for certain. However, I do imagine each tassel being sewn individually, perhaps with a thicker back and an inside that is of something softer and lightweight. Are all the tassels the same length: No, but close. Within an inch or two of one another. Do they drag: No. They're cut so that they obscure the feet, but don't drag. How many layers of tassels: 1 and a half.

The real trick, I think, to making one work would be to, in my opinion, make a cloak which looks cool on its own. Then, slit the bottom 2/3rds up to about the rib-cage area. Sew these into tassels, then sew some more tassels to the inside. Then, perhaps work with the shoulders/inner layers to make the cloak fall down so that it looks enveloping and the sides can fall straight."

- From Brandon Sanderson

By Mistborn Era 2, the mistcloak has evolved into a mistcoat. Waxillium Ladrian's, in particular, is a long, enveloping garment like a duster with a thick collar and cuffed sleeves, ankle-length and divided into strips from just above the waist.</description>

      <description>"The Marabethians have a saying for those who refuse to see the truth of a situation. 'You have eyes of red and blue', they say. Red for blood dripping. Blue for the water. It is said that these two things are all the [criminals] see. Usually they are attacked within one day. And yet, most still wish to take that chance. They prefer the false hope"

- Sigzil on Marabethian criminal policy

Marabethia is a nation on Roshar occupying the isthmus separating the Purelake from the Reshi Sea. It is in the north, in Selay lands beside the sea.

The Marabethian people are known to have a great fondness for debate; the city has many pedestals at intersections where men can stand and proclaim his arguments. The residents are known to carry around overripe fruit for discouraging those they disagree with.

To punish serious crimes, they dangle the perpetrator over a seaside cliff near the city, during a high tide with a cut in each cheek, as bait for the yu-nerig that live there. If the criminal survives for a week, they are set free. The criminals that hang there are usually attacked within a day. A criminal can demand execution instead but almost every prisoner chooses to be hung over the sea, because they prefer false hope to certain death.

Sigzil told Kaladin of Marabethia, because he felt that Kaladin was filling the heads of the bridgemen with false hope.

Lift has been to Marabethia, though she left and travelled to Azir.</description>

      <description>Nanrovah is a priest in the Hallandren Court of Gods prior to the Pahn Kahl rebellion.

Nanrovah is high priest to Stillmark the Noble, and is notably the most outspoken of the priests against going to war with Idris. He meets with Vasher on a few occasions to discuss his opposition to the war. Later, however, he unexpectedly changes his position, suddenly supporting the notion of war. This is due to a calculated attack on his carriage by Denth's crew, who kidnap his daughter Misel, hold her hostage, and threaten to kill her if he doesn't stop openly opposing the war. After her rescue, Nanrovah is able to safely oppose the war again; however, because he had changed his opinion twice by then, the others don't take his arguments as seriously anymore.

Nanrovah is a traditionalist, like his god, and argues against most proposals brought forth in the Court of Gods. His father was one of the wealthiest merchants in Hallandren, and Nanrovah inherited his wealth from him.</description>

      <description>Mistborn: Birthright is a cancelled computer game set in the Final Empire on Scadrial. It was originally expected to be released in Fall of 2013, but was pushed back to a tentative release date of 2015 and moved to the new console generation. It was then planned to be released in Fall 2016.

It would have featured an original storyline created by Brandon Sanderson set several hundreds of years before the first Mistborn novel. The game focused on a unique combat system that put Allomancy into the hands of gamers, as players follow Fendin "Fiddle" Fathvell, an arrogant young nobleman who must quickly master his newfound Allomantic abilities before forces at work can destroy his entire family.

A young Terriswoman was featured in the story.

As of late 2016, Brandon has announced that the game is not going to be happening.</description>

      <description>The Ocean of Origins is a body of water east of Roshar, towards the Origin.

The shores of the Ocean of Origins are sparsely populated, with the cities of New Natanan and Dawn's Shadow being the only notable settlements. This is likely because highstorms make landfall there, and as such hit that coast with the greatest force. To the East, the Ocean of Origins presumably connects to the Endless Ocean on the opposite side of the planet, while from North and South, it's bracketed by Steamwater Ocean and Southern Depths.

The Origin of Storms, where the highstorms originate, lies at the far end of the Ocean of Origins. There are multiple legends talking about there being an inhabited island there, populated by people called Uvara in some versions of the story. The version told in New Natanan says that they are sailors who were lost while travelling the Ocean of Origins and that one day, they will come back to reclaim Natanatan.</description>

      <description>"The Nahel bond is far more intimate a relationship. The linking of spirits. This is not a thing that should be done lightly, unsupervised."

- Notum

The Nahel bond is a connection between a sentient spren and a human or singer. It's a symbiotic relationship, granting a person the power of Surgebinding, and the spren the ability to manifest into the Physical Realm without losing their mind.

Originally, the Nahel bond granted power to individuals with no affiliation with one another. Eventually, the Knights Radiant were formed and the Surgebinders were gathered into ten different Orders of Knights, each Order's members bonded to the same type of spren.</description>

      <description>An Oculator is someone that can activate and control an Oculatory Lens.

The Smedry family is one of the most renowned groups of Oculators. Oculatory powers are primarily hereditary, though they can be inherited either through the bloodline or through marriage. There are two known exceptions to this hereditary limitation: Warrior's Lenses and Blood-Forged Lenses can be used by anyone.

Among the Librarians, there are Dark Oculators, who often use offensive lenses and Alivened.</description>

      <description>MaiPon is a sub-state of the Rose Empire on the planet of Sel. It was absorbed into the Rose Empire long prior to the events of The Emperor's Soul.

MaiPon is the homeland of Forgery. Because Investiture on Sel is concentrated in the Cognitive Realm, and thus dependent on geographic location, the power of a Forgery diminishes the further a forgery is from MaiPon, similar to how the Elantrian Aons function. All Forgeries include a lithograph resembling MaiPon on the reverse side of the stamp.

The MaiPon are descended from the same people group as the JinDo; they diverged long ago. They are commonly mistaken by other cultures as being identical. The MaiPon use chopsticks, known as MaiPon sticks, as eating utensils. The sticks were later adopted in JinDo culture.</description>

During a party, Opa reports to Roial that Lord Redeen fell in to the pond.</description>

The Forger Wan ShaiLu was hired by Han ShuXen to steal the painting and destroy it. She replaces the original with a Forgery she painted with his help, throwing the original into a fire. Han ShuXen did not want his masterpiece to "glorify" the Rose Empire, which he opposed. Shai is imprisoned for the "attempted" theft of the painting and the Moon Scepter and is coerced into Forging a soulstamp for Emperor Ashravan. After her imprisonment, Shai steals the fake painting and leaves a mark in the shape of Aon Reo in its place.</description>

      <description>"Vun Makak eye you. That’s one all right. How am I ever going to catch you, man?"

- Maib to Ishikk after having her gift of soup countered by Ishikk's trade of a kolgril

Maib is a Rosharan Purelaker who lives in the village Fu Abra. She is quite fond of a rare fish, kolgril, as she believes it will help provide relief for the arthritis in her fingers.

She is a talented cook who regularly provides food to Ishikk, hoping to put him in her debt so he feels obliged to marry her. The pair will trade items back and forth in order to try and level the debt that they each owe to the other. Ishikk seems to hold some feelings towards Maib and considers settling down with her someday, however, is not yet ready to give up his life as a roaming fisherman.

Her house is the closest the village has to an inn. It can be found in the middle of the village and provides food and, presumably, accommodation to foreigners. Like many Purelaker buildings, some, if not all, of the floor is covered in several inches of water. Maib has a table in her inn that is raised slightly higher and has accompanying footstools to accommodate for outsiders who do not wish to keep their feet in the water.

Her home was used as a meeting place between Ishikk and several members of the Seventeenth Shard, who had tasked the fisherman with trying to find Hoid.</description>

      <description>"Within a heartbeat, Alezarv was there, crossing a distance that would have taken more than four months to travel by foot."

- Among the Darkeyed, page 102

The Oathgates are structures on Roshar that allow people to instantaneously teleport from one location to another. There are twenty in total, with ten located in Urithiru, while the other ten sit in various cities across the continent.

These fabrials manipulate the Surge of Transportation. Together, they form a network of gateways with Urithiru at its center, allowing for near-instantaneous travel between all corners of the world, and letting people unable to fly access to the tower-city itself. They can only be operated by someone wielding a living Shardblade, such as a Knight Radiant, or with an Honorblade. They require Stormlight to work, with transportation of more than one person demanding more Stormlight than what the Oathgate can normally hold in its ten gemstone lanterns.</description>

- Kalak's thoughts in the wake of Aharietiam

The Order of Dustbringers is an order of Knights Radiant on Roshar.

The Dustbringers are Surgebinders who control the Surges of Division and Abrasion; they are associated with the ruby polestone. They form Nahel bonds with ashspren.

The Dustbringers dislike their name due to its similarity to Voidbringer, and want to be called Releasers.</description>

Miliv disliked Lirin, the local surgeon from Hearthstone, for unknown reasons. Lirin's son, Kaladin, believed that many of the rumors about their family in Hearthstone were started by Miliv.

Miliv was married to a woman who worked as a nurse to Brightlady Laral Wistiow. After Laral's father died, the nurse didn't let Kaladin visit Laral because she believed that the boys from the town were inappropriate friends for Laral.

Sometime after Citylord Roshone arrived to replace Wistiow, Miliv died and was replaced as steward by Natir.</description>

      <description>"The unicorn is a noble and majestic animal!"

- Melody

Melody is a student at Armedius Academy} at the same time as Joel Saxon.

She is a Rithmatist, but is not very good at drawing circles and other defensive formations. However, she is gifted at drawing chalklings, especially unicorns. Joel once took a look at her notebook and found it full of castles and unicorns.

Melody was William's sister. They came from the Floridian Atolls where their parents still lived. Both of Melody's parents and all of her siblings are Rithmatists. Due to the great distance between their home and the Academy, they only came visit Melody one time a year, when the Melee happens.

Melody and Joel Saxon, working as a team, won the Melee and defeated Inspector Harding.

Both parents as well as William's and Melody's sibling are Rithmatists, a fact that seemed to be nearly impossible.</description>

She was one of the first victims of the Scribbler, and the first that occurred within the book's timeline.

Lilly was sixteen at the time of the Rithmatist prologue, and had lived in Jamestown all her life. It is assumed that her family is at least moderately wealthy, due to the fact that she attends Armedius Academy as a Rithmatist, and that her home, which is described in the prologue, has a grandfather clock, fine rugs, painted walls, dark wooden floors, broad picture windows, and a rocking chair.</description>

Stephen Leeds approaches him as he is leaving his colleague after finishing his shift. At first he was reticent to chat to Stephen as a tourist, but is impressed by Stephen's ability with Hebrew, and asks him if he's Jewish. He tells Stephen that he works the same shift most days and is meant to stop people doing bad things, particularly watching for terrorists. He's somewhat seasonally employed, mainly to make sure the site looks secure during times of large tourism.

He remembers seeing Balubal Razon trying to take pictures two days before Stephen's visit, and notes his strange method of taking pictures; always using flash and not minding if people get in the way, taking pictures in strange places and of nothing in particular.</description>

      <description>Misel was a young Hallandren on Nalthis.

She was Nanrovah's daughter, and was kidnapped by Denth to use as leverage. The kidnapping was used as leverage to force Nanrovah to support the war against Idris, and her return allowed him to retract his support.

Misel was kept in a dingy cage in a thieves' den. Vivenna and Vasher rescued her, and walked her back to her father's house. The rescued child was clearly traumatized and non-verbal, but Vasher had Vivenna back away and then asked Misel to repeat a Command he told her, which appeared to cause her to completely forget her dreadful experience.</description>

      <description>Mudbeer is an alcoholic drink on Roshar.

It is served in taverns throughout western Roshar, people often turning to it in the depths of winter.

The Unkalaki use mudbeer to duel. When two people disagree, they compete to see who can drink the most and still sing. Usually, they both end up too drunk to remember what they were arguing about in the first place.

When Kaladin decides to help Bridge Four escape, he promises them that they would all be drinking mudbeer in some tavern within a few weeks.</description>

He welcomes Torol Sadeas to Dalinar's warcamp when Sadeas was investigating Dalinar's grooms to see if they were involved on the supposed attempt on King Elhokar Kholin's life. Sadeas had to be escorted by a lighteyes, and Moratel, being the least important, is sent. It is implied that all in attendance knew that Moratel would be sent for this purpose.

It is unclear what happened to Moratel during the Battle of Narak.</description>

      <description>Lolan is a servant at Mercystar's palace in Hallandren on Nalthis circa 327.

When Vasher infiltrated the palace, he encountered a group of four servants in the hallway. He used his common distraction tactic of throwing Nightblood (in his sheath) at the group, and also tied up Taff with an Awakened rope. Lolan picked up Nightblood, thinking he might use it against the attacker, while Rariv and the remaining servant ran for help. Vasher then knocked Lolan out while he was distracted by the sword. Taff was subsequently killed by Denth, but Lolan was spared, presumably because he was unconscious and would not have been able to identify Denth.

Lolan recounted his version of the events during an investigation by Lightsong, and was hesitant to show his injured hand. He eventually revealed that his hand had turned gray, meaning that he started to draw Nightblood and the sword began to consume his soul. This implies that Nightblood regarded Lolan as "evil", and he was indeed repentant after speaking to Lightsong.</description>

      <description>Mord is a darkeyed resident of Hearthstone on Roshar.

Mord likely came from a family of farmers, as he was among a group of youths (also including Jost, Jest, Tift, Naget, and Khav) that was tasked with removing diggerworms from the lavis fields outside of Hearthstone. He hung out with the same group of boys after work hours were over, and once witnessed a fight between Kaladin and Jost.

Kaladin cited his name as an example of a 'solid, Alethi darkeyes' name, unlike his own.</description>

After most of his superior officers were killed during the Battle of the Tower, Gaval was promoted and given a field commission as commander of the rear guard by Kaladin. He was ordered to oversee the retreat of the rest of Dalinar's army. Once he took command, the army begins to retreat over the bridge in a quick, orderly fashion.

Gaval was a member of Dalinar Kholin's expedition to the center of the Shattered Plains. He participated in the Battle of Narak, leading the troop of soldiers accompanying Renarin and Shallan in their investigation of the Stormseat Oathgate. At some point, Gaval became Adolin's Plate standby, wearing Adolin's Shardplate when he was unavailable to do so. During the Battle of Thaylen Field, Adolin hoped that Gaval was heading to the battle with his Plate, but the two never met during that battle.</description>

      <description>Newcago is the name of the city founded and led by Steelheart on the metallic ruins of Chicago.

Steelheart rules Newcago with a steel fist, but is eventually killed by the Reckoners.

During Steelheart's fit of rage after he was shot and inexplicably wounded, he transformed much of Lake Michigan, the city, and much of the underground into solid steel in an event known as the Great Transfersion. The upper class and party members live above, while peasants live in a network of caverns and factories underground. It is said the Epic Digzone granted some of his powers to the Diggers, who eventually went insane, causing the tunnels to become erratic and impossible to navigate. It is in these tunnels that the Reckoners have one of their hideouts. David Charleston grew up in a weapons factory there.

Newcago is one of few locations left in America that still has running water, infrastructure, electricity, food, and a police force. Even though it was ruled under the oppressive regime of Steelheart, people flocked to it, even if they lived in poor conditions. The police force is known as Enforcement and is heavily militarized.

Newcago is also the base of operations for Steelheart's three main subordinates: Firefight, Conflux, and Nightwielder. The city was kept in perpetual darkness, except for the light from Calamity, by Nightwielder before he was killed during the Steelheart hit.

There are about 250,000 people in Newcago. 1,000 or so of these people are Epics.</description>

      <description>Limmi was a member of House Ladrian's household, the head of the ground-floor staff.

Lord Waxillium Ladrian had Limmi draft his response to House Yomen, indicating that he and Lady Steris Harms would be attending their wedding reception. Soon afterward, when Lord Harms visited Ladrian manor, Limmi was unable to stop him from interrupting Wax and Wayne's conversation about the Vanishers, despite her best efforts.

Later, while further investigating the Vanishers, Wax had Limmi bring him broadsheets from the Elendel Daily covering recent events and the robberies in particular.

Tillaume, Wax's butler, knocked Limmi out prior to his assassination attempt on Wax. He hid her and Miss Grimes in a closet, presumably to protect them from the potential explosion. After the explosion, Wax carried Limmi and Miss Grimes outside to the back garden, hoping the constables or Krent, his coachman, would find them.</description>

He is about Vin's age.

He asks Valette Renoux to dance at the ball at Keep Elariel. She accepts in an attempt to make Elend ask her to dance. She considers Melend to be overly formal and inexperienced, and asks him about Elend, who he knows very little about. He thinks she's very good at dancing, and flirts quite heavily with her. He lets slip that Shan Elariel had gossip about her.</description>

His name is unknown, as the term "Mraize" is a title, not a name. He corrects Shallan when she attempts to call him 'Brightlord.' Shallan mentions that the title is not Vorin in origin, and difficult to pronounce. As he also refers to Iyatil as his babsk, a Thaylen title, it is evidenced that he is from Thaylenah.</description>

"But as for the Bondsmiths, they had members only three, which number was not uncommon for them; nor did they seek to increase this by great bounds, for during the times of Madasa, only one of their order was in continual accompaniment of Urithiru and its thrones. Their spren was understood to be specific, and to persuade them to grow to the magnitude of the other orders was seen as seditious."

Moelach is one of the Unmade, an ancient and terrible spren of Odium. He is one of the great Mindless Unmade, like Ashertmarn and Nergaoul, more a force or a creature of instinct than a conscious being. Moelach is the source of the Death Rattles, visions of the future experienced by people on Roshar during their final moments of life.

      <description>Mistborn Prime is the eleventh novel written by Brandon Sanderson.

Allomancy was originally a part of Mistborn Prime, although only Mistborn were included. Mistings, as a concept, were only created when Allomancy was added to Mistborn: The Final Empire. Another element that was added was emotional Allomancy, zinc and bronze.

Mistwraiths also originally appeared here, where they play a more prominent role. They are more of a threat than the scavengers they become in the published works, and the hero fights one.

OreSeur orginated here and was the only character from this novel to make the move into The Final Empire.</description>

Since the Reckoners generally attack High Epics with a prime invincibility, it is likely Lightning is a High Epic with one such ability.</description>

      <description>"I follow the orders of no man, mortal or Epic ... I am the cleansing fire."

- Obliteration to Newton

Obliteration is a High Epic who believes that it is his duty to destroy all of humanity.

Along with Steelheart and Night's Sorrow, he is among the most feared and powerful of Epics, but unlike Steelheart, he is currently not a tyrant. He is, however, a ruthless killer, who has made it his mission to kill everyone because he believes that all humans are corrupt and have the seed of the Epic inside of them. Five years after the rise of Calamity, he conquered his fear and was thus able to free himself of his corruption, though this did not influence his morals - he remained a ruthless destroyer. While he did rule Houston at one point, he ultimately decided to melt the entire city, killing the entire town's population in the process.</description>

      <description>Lua is one of Stephen Leeds' aspects.

He is a Samoan survivalist who is described as a beefy man with a big smile. He weighs about three hundred pounds. In the White Room he would start conversations with whoever was closest.

Lua builds a "stone age" house in his spare time, using only technology he could build by himself. When Jenny manifests and Stephen begins losing aspects, he is working on the hearth of the house. He also runs or helps run a Cub Scout troop.

While Stephen is chasing after Sandra, Lua left the house to grab something from his survival hut, but he disappeared. He then showed up to help Stephen escape the survival-island simulation. Claiming that he had broken too many rules by teleporting and constructing a catamaran instantaneously, he vanishes without becoming a nightmare.</description>

She is Korean, and is Stephen's surgeon and field medic. During the White Room she analyzes the effects of inserting extra DNA into muscle cells.

Along with Clive and Arnaud, Mi Won is among the aspects best equipped to think about higher-level chemistry. She concludes that I3 and Yol Chay are keeping information from Stephen.

Later, when Stephen began to lose control of his aspects, Mi Won was the first to arrive when Armando died. She left the room and told Ivy of the death. Ivy then pushed into the room and demanded more details.</description>

      <description>Ngozi is one of Stephen Leeds' aspects.

She's a tall Nigerian woman and a forensic investigator. She had been educated at Oxford university and had a phobia of germs.

Stephen didn't take her along to the coroner, but ended up video conferencing her, much to Stephens surprise, as he didn't know he could do that. This was necessary, as not only was she not present at the time, but she also takes a lot of time to get out of the house, as with her phobia she believes that going outside without proper equipment (i.e. a hazmat suit) is very dangerous. This is, of course, ignoring the fact that as she is simply a hallucination, she cannot be effected by the germs in question unless Stephen imagines it happening.

After Armando's death, Ngozi saw the blood in the room and backed away to get some fresh air. Ivy comforted her and helped her to calm down. Stephen then asked her to go with him to the fairgrounds to investigate the possible crime scene. She came through the crowd and Stephen was very proud of her. She investigated the scene where the GPS coordinates led. She noticed that the same man was buying from the hot dog vendor in a lot of the pictures they took of the scene with Razon's camera. When Armando killed Tobias Ngozi knelt by his body and tried to bandage him getting her arms bloody and likely freaking her out because of her phobia. She helped Stephen sneak into Walters and Ostman Detention Enterprises and she wanted to use the air ducts multiple times. Ngozi died when the mob scene virtual reality was enacted with a bullet to her forehead.</description>

David Charleston met Marco briefly while attending a party in Babilar with Mizzy. Marco shared the same peacefully fatalistic attitude towards the state of the world as many people in Babilar, and condemned the Reckoners, believing that their resistance only provoked the Epics and made things worse for ordinary people. Naturally, he did not know that his friend Mizzy was a Reckoner. He told Mizzy that Regalia had poached one of Revokation's personal surgeons from Great Falls.</description>

      <description>Missouri Williams, known as Mizzy, is a member of the Reckoners.

She is based with Valentine and Exel in Babilar. She is dark-skinned and slight of build, and wears her hair back in a way that David describes as an Afro mushroom cloud. Mizzy has a bubbly and optimistic view on life, and is very trusting, but still desperately wants to kill Megan, who had previously killed Sam, Mizzy's mentor. However, David helps her focus this thirst for vengeance towards Calamity, the true source of the problem. Mizzy is the sniper for her team, and has experience with explosives, equipment, and repairs, but wants to be point. It is stated by Megan and David that after Calamity is defeated, Mizzy becomes an Epic, although they are not certain how she will take to being one.</description>

She is snubbed by Kairominas, taking offence at Kai's epiphany of the Wode's steering him into a "perfect battle", and particularly at Kai's refusal to fight her. After this Melhi repeatedly hacks Kai's world and sends robots to fight him. This culminates in the creation of Sophie, a perfect human replica who Kai takes a liking to on a date ordered by the Wode to fulfill XinWey's Doctrine. She helps him defeat a robot sent by Melhi and then shoots herself under the command of Melhi.</description>

- Kairominas

Liveborn are the human inhabitants of the States. They are each given a State to live in when born and the State is constructed based on their personality, to make their life fulfilling. Given that the States are simulated worlds, the actual physical bodies of the Liveborn are merely brains put in jars filled with a nutrient bath. All of this, including the machinery needed for the simulation, fits in a box the size of a melon.</description>

Lorists are very secretive and do very little actual fieldwork for the Reckoners. They can't risk getting caught lest they should be tortured and reveal what little information they actually have about the Epics. Their studies may be valuable as the information can help reveal an Epic's weakness.

      <description>Maindew is a corporal of the Elendel constabulary in Claude Aradel's precinct.

Maindew always made a point of saluting his superior officer. However, Aradel seemed to view his constant saluting as sycophantic and instructed him not to bother saluting while indoors, since they were constantly crossing paths. Nevertheless, Maindew saluted Aradel while he met with Marasi in his office. Aradel threw some wadded-up broadsheets in his face in order to discourage him, and Maindew apologized.</description>

      <description>Mirabell was a statistician and psychologist on Scadrial.

Mirabell lived some time during the third century after the Catacendre (201-300), presumably in or near the Elendel Basin. They studied productivity in the workplace, and found that having a sense of ownership helped to improve morale. They may have published their research in a book or paper called Mirabell's Rules.

Marasi Colms applied Mirabell's theories to communities, and she found that crime tended to be lower where the residents had a sense of identity in their neighborhoods. Marasi thinks about Mirabell's work in relation to the growing unrest in Elendel, as the more transient nature of modern society has eroded people's sense of community (and by extension, their trust in government).</description>

Kelsier lived there with his wife Mare before their raid on Kredik Shaw that sent both of them to the Pits of Hathsin. They had to quickly abandon their dwelling there because Kelsier killed several nobles to avenge the death of a skaa servant girl. She had been executed for spilling some tea.</description>

      <description>The Mastrell's Path is the name of a test used by the sand masters of Taldain. The rules do not restrict who may take the test, although it is meant only for those who have already achieved the highest rank of mastrell. The test is not mandatory and many mastrells choose not to take it. The Path was created by the very most powerful and egotistical sand masters as a way of showcasing their superiority and is therefore extraordinarily challenging.

The Path consists of five spheres hidden around the Kerla. The challenger is not allowed to take any water and must find as many spheres as he can within a Dayside hour, or 100 minutes. The challenger is monitored by a group of mastrells; he may request help at any time, but if he does, his run is automatically terminated. There is no "pass" or "fail", as one's performance is judged by how many spheres he is able to obtain within the time limit.

Central to the Path is a massive deep sandling, specifically a Marken, normally only found in the deep sands but isolated on the Kerla for unknown reasons. This sandling is even more rare because it is terken, or immune to the powers of sand mastery. The Mastrells have fed the creature for centuries and use it as the final guardian for the fifth sphere.

The intended solution for the Marken was to slatrify sand into water and use it to scare the creature away. Kenton, who could not slatrify, was forced to use his sword instead to kill the creature, forever ruining the Path.

When Traiben ran the Path he only found three spheres. When he slatrified and frightened away the sandling, its digging buried his last sphere deep beneath the sand, preventing him from retrieving it.</description>

They believe that their existence is not continuous, but rather that when they are asleep (or presumably unconscious) their experience comes to an end and they are reborn the next day, inheriting their memories and beliefs from their previous incarnation.

Arclo mentions the Omnithi to Lift. He wonders why their society continues to exist given the belief that an individual only lasts for one day. He also comments about how hard such a philosophy is to disprove, and this philosophy is little more than ideal theory to him.

Arclo apparently traveled to the world the Omnithi inhabit, and says Lift will never visit them. This could indicate the Omnithi are not a Rosharan culture, or could indicate the land has been destroyed and no longer exists.</description>

- Wax's thoughts about Matieu

Mrs. Hutchen is a possible resident of Ironstand on Scadrial, or a placeholder name in a figure of speech used by Wax.

Wax thought Captain Matieu of the Ironstand constabulary was more used to dealing with someone stealing Mrs. Hutchen's milk than train robberies. However, Wax is not known to have spent time in Ironstand, and it is likely that he was simply citing a common surname on Scadrial while making a sarcastic observance.</description>

Obrodai is a Shardworld in the Cosmere.

The Shard Autonomy has claimed Obrodai and is beginning to manifest an "avatar of [their] being," an unknown female entity, on the planet. It is unknown if there are any other Shards active on Obrodai.

In a letter to Hoid, Patji, an avatar of Autonomy warned him not to return to Obrodai and that, as a precaution to discourage his return, the avatar there has been instilled with a great dislike of him.</description>

      <description>The Mythica is a book written by Hessi.

It is a book on the Unmade, and Shallan says that the book wasn't received well. It is a new book, and mentions Jasnah at least once, to disagree with some of her work and questionings. This book is not in many bookstores, and the few that had it in Kholinar were stolen. This book does not contain the information from the events of Urithiru.

Hessi talks of most of the Unmade, such as Sja-anat and Ashertmarn. Hessi's Mythica advises the reader on how to tell the signs of some of the Unmade, and what to do if these signs are found. This usually involves running. She has found that Sja-anat was the most feared by Radiants, for her ability to corrupt spren--though it only spoke of "lesser spren" which she did not understand the meaning of--and was often referred to as an individual, when others were seen as forces instead. She can only speculate on the ninth Unmade, but has firm beliefs on the other eight. Hessi holds fast to the idea that the Unmade were spren imbued with vast powers, and as such are manifestations of concepts and divine forces as much as individuals. In the last section of this book, Hessi speculates on the ninth Unmade, going over anything she does not know enough about, or could have confused into another Unmade. She theorizes on whether the ninth is Dai-Gonarthis, and whether their actions could have truly caused the destruction of Aimia. Many Unmade she does not know much about, such as Ba-Ado-Mishram and Chemoarish. She cannot find any speculation on their powers or effects, only to say that Ba-Ado-Mishram was a commander of the enemy forces, and that Chemoarish is not the Nightwatcher.

In this book, Hessi attributes personalities to the Unmade, and describes how they ran wild during the Desolations, the nine Unmade. She also claims not all of them were destroyed in Aharietiam, and insists that some are alive today. Hessi gives a brief description of the known unmade, saying what they do and what they are called. She believes that the three mindless Unmade are still around, Nergaoul as the Thrill, giving battle rage to both sides, and visions of red mist and dying animals, as said in the legends. Moelach as the Death Rattles, because they seem to be regional, moving about across Roshar, as well as this Moelach was said to give their visions most commonly in the transition point between realms, when a soul is nearing the Tranquiline Halls, and the Death Rattles seem oddly prophetic, too much so to be cast away as not a possibility. Hessi speculates that Moelach is the reason why predicting the future is of the enemy, as that telling the future is believed to originate from him. The third great mindless Unmade is Ashertmarn, Heart of the Revel. There is not much she can find that might come from this Unmade, but she speculates that the great debauchery of Bayala in 480, leading to dynastic collapse, may have been the influence of Ashertmarn.

Shallan finds the book while in Kholinar. She uses it to discover that there are two Unmade inside Kholinar: Sja-anat and Ashertmarn.

      <description>"The story mentions the Desolations at the beginning. Giving them credit for having wiped out Parasaphi's people."

- Navani about the myth

The Myth of Parasaphi and Nadris is the creation myth of the Makabaki people of Roshar. Navani Kholin and Renarin Kholin discuss it while trying to understand Dalinar's visions and the Desolations. Evi Kholin told the story to Renarin when he was a child.

According to the story, Parasaphi was a woman whose people had been all but wiped out in a Desolation, while Nadris was a man--perhaps her partner--on his deathbed. In order to preserve her people, Parasaphi climbed the peaks of Dara to find seedstones, stones touched by the Heralds. She collected them and brought them down to Nadris, then harvested his seed to bring life to the stones. Ten children sprang out and with them, Parasaphi founded the nation of Marnah.

This legend says that the Makabaki people are all descended from Parasaphi's children. This would mean Marnah predates the Silver Kingdoms of Makabakam. However, in the modern day, it's unclear which mountain range corresponds to the peaks of Dara. The telling of the myth changes, each naming different mountain ranges for the peaks.

Dalinar Kholin found the idea that people would be born from rocks to be ridiculous.</description>

      <description>The Mausoleum is a mansion in Kholinar.

Little is known about its layout. There is a sizeable larder on the outer wall, and a grand hall, presumably by the entrance. The hall is lined with statues created by Soulcasting the household's favorite servants -- an honor typically reserved only for lighteyes -- which is where the nickname came from.

Maps of the Mausoleum can be purchased on Kholinar's black market, and there are rumours that the building holds grand riches somewhere deep within. The family currently owning it, the Tenets, are likewise supposed to be exquisitely wealthy.

Although Shallan and her team infiltrate the house, they take none of this supposed wealth, only raiding the larder for the food to bribe the Cult of Moments.</description>

- Excerpt from drawer 12-15, ruby, in the Urithiru gem archive

Molinar is a child mentioned in one of the records in the Urithiru gem archive. Since their father and sibling have Thaylen styled names, it is likely Molinar is Thaylen or part-Thaylen.

Their mother was planning to depart Urithiru and was given the opportunity to leave a message. She chose to leave a record of her family. A ruby was used to record the message, so she was likely a Dustbringer.

She felt Molinar, as well as Molinars's sibling Kmakra, were the true gemstones of her life.</description>

Naze-daughter-Kuzodo is an ancient resident of Roshar who is quoted in the Urithiru gem archive.

Naze warned of unintended side-effects to Melishi's plan to trap Ba-Ado-Mishram in a perfect gemstone.

Naze is a contemporary of Melishi and has significant knowledge about the Voidbringers; it is highly likely that she was one of the many Knights Radiant based in Urithiru prior to the Recreance. Her name implies that she is of Shin origin.</description>

      <description>Natata Ved, also known as Natata Oileyes or simply Oileyes, was an ancient Veden scholar on Roshar. Her nickname was given to her by her contemporaries, but its meaning is unknown.

Natata lived in Jah Keved two hundred years after the death of King NanKhet and the founding of the Siln dynasty. She is best known for writing a dramatized account of NanKhet's life and death, which is the earliest source of information about him to have survived to the present day.

Despite the long time passing between NanKhet's death and her work, she insisted that her research was rigorous, although Jasnah Kholin notes that modern scholarship was still in its infancy during Natata's lifetime. Oileyes is said to have had a passion for the dramatic, and took delight in describing the irony of NanKhet's final moments.

"“The great, but weary, NanKhet called for an accounting of all his household. He gathered them together at a grand feast, promising the delights of distant Aimia. Instead, when all were assembled, NanKhet had them executed one by one. Their bodies were burned in a grand pyre, upon which was cooked the meat for the feast that he ate alone, at a table set for two hundred.”"

The Mindstone is a piece of crystal that connects the Knights of Crystallia together. It is a shard from the Worldspire. It connects all of the Crystin together, allowing them to share abilities. That means that if one of them knows how to do something, each of the rest of them get a tiny bit better at that thing. The specifics of the Mindstone are implied to not be known to the general population outside of the Crystin.</description>

      <description>"Poor kid. Better you than he."

- Muri to Shallan after Grund's death

Muri is a darkeyed seamstress of the second nahn in Kholinar on Roshar.

During the True Desolation, she fled the occupation of Revolar to Kholinar, losing her successful seamstressing business and moving into a hovel. She has three daughters and struggled to feed them during the Siege of Kholinar, resorting to search water ditches for dead rats and cremlings for food. She is usually regarded as "nice" and "pleasant," and generally had amusing gossip.

When Veil asks Grund about people who might need food, Muri is the first person he lists. Veil proceeds to donate some food to Muri and several other beggars and refugees. However, a gang known as the Grips terrorizes anyone who receives donations, ultimately killing Grund. Muri always had to wait for Veil for her food. Muri's handler from the Grips had an argument with another man, and Muri overheard her name so was hurriedly packing her and her family's bags to flee. Muri angrily chides Veil, telling Veil that she should have died instead of Grund, then leaves.

Veil suffers a mental crisis after learning that her poor judgment lead to suffering and death, and is consoled by Wit.</description>

      <description>Mrs. Maheras is the mother of Panos & Dion.

She is a first-generation Greek American with a heavy Greek accent. She keeps a well tended lawn and a number of tomato plants. She is a very religious member of the Greek Orthodox church and rather disappointed that both of her sons became atheists. Her house is full of kitsch.

She worked together with Father Frangos to steal the body of her son Panos in order to prevent a cremation, as it goes against her faith. She did this by imitating the cleaning lady's patterns exactly going as far as practing her signature. She got caught because she didn't practice copying the numbers and she has a very distinctive zero. She was relieved when Stephen convinced the government to put Panos' body into cold storage instead of cremation.</description>

The ship is found by Spensa in a cavern about thirty minutes walk from Alta.

M-Bot's data banks were corrupted, but it remembers its last pilot, named Commander Spears. The only information M-Bot could find was a command from Spears: "Lie low, M-Bot. Take stock, don't get into any fights, and wait for me here."</description>

Nedd Strong (callsign Nedder) is a member of the DDF and pilot number two in Skyward Flight. He is flight assistant to Jorgen during flight school, however, it is unknown if he retains this position after gaining full pilot status. Although originally removed from the DDF flight program, Nedd is reinstated after the Battle of Alta Second, likely due to his heroics during the Krell assault.

Nedd has two older brothers, both DDF pilots; Nightstorm Six--Callsign: Vent--and Nightstorm Seven, and grew up living in Alta Base, where his parents keep the orchards. His family is well off, likely due to the risk associated with his parent's work, however, not as rich as some of the families in the lower caverns. Prior to flight school, Nedd went to school in the deep caverns, where he became good friends with Jorgen and Arturo.</description>

      <description>Callsign Nose is flight leader of Nightmare Flight. The other members are Nord, Bog, Sushi, Jager, and Tunestone.

As part of their training, Skyward Flight were paired with Nightmare Flight for a routine debris tagging mission. During the exercise, Nose paired Sushi and Nord with Jorgen, and Bog and Tunestone with Spensa and FM, instructing them to demonstrate ship maneuvers for the cadets. After witnessing Spensa and FM's light-lancing skills, Nose offered them both positions in Nightmare Flight. When Jorgen, FM, and Spensa attracted the attention of the Krell, Nose tried to pair the cadets with members of Nightmare Flight. However, Jorgen intervened, asking for Skyward Flight to remain together. Nose granted the request then instructed the pilots to watch for Lifebusters and remain evasive until Riptide Flight could arrive to reinforce them.

Later, Nightmare Flight participated in the Second Battle of Alta.</description>

      <description>A master-servant is a Vorin profession that can be held by darkeyed citizens of the second nahn. They are hired to work for well-off lighteyes and to attend to their needs. They perform a number of duties including, but not limited to, fetching refreshments and meals, delivering messages, and staffing events and institutions. A variety of hand signals can be used to indicate to the master-servant what task is required, or simply to request assistance.

The standard uniform for a master-servant includes a crisp white shirt with an emblem over the breast and either black pants or a black skirt. Those with long hair will often wear it bound. Master-servants in training have an all black uniform and there is no emblem on their shirts. The refined manner in which they act is a point of pride for most master-servants, though this attitude is mocked by those of other classes.

Master-servants staff the Kharbranthian Conclave and the Palanaeum.

Szeth posed as a master servant when he broke into the Conclave in Kharbranth to kill Taravangian.</description>

      <description>Midpeace is a period that marks the middle of the Rosharan year.

The Rosharan year is 500 days long and ends with a four week period of rain known as the Weeping. Midpeace occurs at the midpoint between Weepings. Highstorms occur more frequently as Midpeace approaches and after it ends, but they do not occur at all during Midpeace. Although the exact duration of Midpeace is not mentioned, it is the longest sustained period on Roshar without rain; since "natural" storms that are not highstorms or the Everstorm are rare, many rivers typically dry up by the end of Midpeace.

Residents of Roshar use the fair weather of Midpeace to celebrate and travel. Alethkar, Jah Keved, and possibly other nations hold outdoor festivals known as Middlefest Fairs. Yokska mentions traveling to Liafor during Midpeace to see the latest fashion trends.</description>

First that highstorm nobody knew about, then the rains stop early, then the storming king man of Alethkar on my doorstep. Now this. I think we might be abandoning camp, even though nightfall’s around the corner."

- Chilinko to Lopen about the potential abandonment of Little Herdaz

Little Herdaz is a district within the Sebarial warcamp on the Shattered Plains on Roshar. Many of the Herdazians in the warcamps live there, among them Lopen's family, including his mother, his uncle and several of his cousins.

The buildings there are mostly hovels. Though nominally, Little Herdaz is under Sebarial's rule, the locals do not consider this particularly important, and police themselves. This self-seclusion is what leads Lopen and Kaladin to hide king Elhokar there following Graves's assassination attempt.

It's uncertain what happened to Little Herdaz following the Battle of Narak. Though Sebarial's warcamp survived the Everstorm without much damage, owning to the protection of the half-ruined dome it'd been built in, most of his people relocated to Urithiru along with their highprince. As shortly after the battle, Chilinko speculated that the district might get an order to move soon, it is possible the people of Little Herdaz are now in Urithiru.</description>

      <description>A Light-line is a technology device that takes the form of a bracelet. It can project weightless glowing ropes that can be attached to two different objects. While being created, the lines must be in contact with the device, but multiple lines can then exist alone until the power given to the lines have run out. This device is especially useful when exploring cave systems or descending heights, as demonstrated by Spensa and her father's usage. It is quite durable, needing only to be charged once a while to function over ten years.

It resembles a mini version of the Light-lance used on DDF starfighters. They are used by pilots and can be requisitioned from the quartermaster. Spensa's light-line is unknown to the DDF, and although Cobb is aware of it, he has not reported it.

Technology such as light-lines survived the crash of the Defiant onto Detritus, as well as subsequent destruction of the fleets electronic archive, and have been passed down through the generations. Before the crash, light-lines were used by the engineers while they worked on ship machinery in zero gravity.</description>

      <description>National Assembly Leaders, or NALs, are members of the National Assembly, the governing body of the Defiant League on Detritus.

The National Assembly Leaders are usually highly influential and merited citizens of Detritus' lower caverns. They have vast authority over the DDF matters. They observe their entry tests, have access to classified data and can directly interfere with DDF's functioning, including staffing decisions. Judy Ivans answers directly to them, though they usually interact with her through their underlings.

The National Assembly Leaders are often descended from the mutineers in the fleet that brought people to Detritus. Ivans speculates that this might be why many of them push against acknowledging the "defect".</description>

Nightingale fought against the Krell in the Battle of Alta and did not survive the battle, however, if they did, they would be considered a First Citizen. It is unclear which flight Nightingale belonged to or how they died, however, it is possible that they were a part of Hope Flight.

Ironsides may have greatly disliked Nightingale, however, it is unclear.</description>

      <description>"I should say something here, about loss. Something wise. Old Mara, who taught me to fly, would have. She's dead now."

- Cobb while trying to console Skyward Flight following the deaths of Morningtide and Bim

Mara is a female pilot on Detritus. She is a wise woman who is good at consoling people during times of loss and grief.

Cobb refers to her as 'Old Mara' -- it is unclear if she was an older woman, if this was a nickname, or if he is referring to the amount of time that has passed since he knew her.

She was Cobb's instructor in his youth, and at some point she passed away. Mara's role in teaching Cobb implies that she was a member of the DDF.</description>

      <description>"The Second Octant constables clustered and watched the crowd for pickpockets from the steps up into the National Archives."

- Marasi's observations upon arriving for Governor Innate's speech

The National Archives is a building in Elendel on Scadrial.

The National Archives are located in the Second Octant, near the Field of Rebirth and across from the governor's mansion. Presumably, they store important historical documents.

Governor Replar Innate liked to address people from the governor's mansion. On at least one such occasion, in 342, the constables kept an eye on the people from the steps leading up to the National Archives.</description>

      <description>Malmahan's Folly is a tower in the Blackened Lands on Mirandus. It is located near the Backflow and the Warfields of Karkun.

It is clearly related to Malmahan the Uncalled somehow. The tower was burned seven times, and its structure still remains. There is a legend that Malmahan's soul still is alive at the tower.

When Paul Tanasin first arrived on Mirandus, he and Feotora traveled near Malmahan's Folly.</description>

      <description>Liza is a coroner living in America.

She is in her late fifties. She is very tall. She likes to be called a medical examiner. She constantly plays games while on duty. She has difficulty interacting with people and so finds a job as a coroner to be satisfactory. She does not enjoy paperwork or meetings. Tobias adores her but Stephen doesn't know what Tobias saw in her.

While Stephen was investigating the disappearance of Panos Maheras' body, he talked to Liza in order to try and find clues. She wore a white lab coat over jeans and a pink buttoned blouse. She describes herself as busy to avoid helping Stephen but was playing games. Liza was curious about the disappearance because the commissioner had insisted the body was to stay in the morgue until it was stolen. Liza agreed to trade an interview between Stephen and a psychologist for 15 minutes of looking around the morgue.</description>

Gaseous Investiture within the Rosharan system manifests as a number of different Lights, each associated with one or more Shards. These Rosharan Lights include the three pure ones - Stormlight, Voidlight, and Lifelight - a few hybrids (Warlight and Towerlight being the only confirmed ones), and the anti-Lights.</description>

Mercy was involved in a battle between Odium and Ambition, which resulted in a wound in the Spiritual Realm and had profound effects on the planet Threnody. This is likely the battle where Ambition was Splintered. Some time around the True Desolation, Harmony reached out to Mercy about the threat posed by Odium, but became worried by Mercy as a result of their exchange.</description>

In the Physical Realm, it is near Sesemalex Dar, and its peninsula is a river that separates Emul and Tukar.

The Oathbound Spires's name and proximity to Lasting Integrity may suggest the place is under honorspren control.

      <description>Merit is a groom on Roshar.

Merit was a member of the team that was sent on a diplomatic mission to Lasting Integrity by the coalition of monarchs. They were present in Urithiru when the team departed and led the pack animals onto the Oathgate. During the team's journey in Shadesmar, they removed the supplies that Gallant was carrying in order to give him a rest. Merit was presumably experienced with Ryshadium, as Gallant was known to have disdain for common grooms. Merit returned to Urithiru within a few weeks after Adolin surrendered to the honorspren.</description>

      <description>Microkinesis is an Invested Art on Yolen.

Microkinesis grants the power to manipulate the forces that bind axi together. According to Khriss, it is a sort of cousin to the Surge of Cohesion, although it has the potential to be far more "explosive" than the use of Cohesion, as Honor placed limits on what Cohesion could do to avoid replicating the the dangerous capabilities of microkinesis. On the other hand, microkinesis does not grant the same Connection to the shaped material that Cohesion does.</description>

      <description>"This force was time infinite. It was the winds that weathered, the storms that broke, the timeless waves running slowly, slowly, slowly, to a stop as the sun and the planet cooled to nothing. It was the ultimate end and destiny of all things. And it was angry."

- Kelsier

Ruin, also known as Herr in Southern Scadrial, is one of the Shards of Adonalsium. Its original Vessel was Ati, but it's currently held by Sazed alongside Preservation, forming Harmony. Ruin's Investiture is typically associated with the color black.</description>

      <description>"The infinity of a note held perfectly, never wavering. The majesty of a painting, frozen and still, capturing a slice of life from a time gone by. It was the power of many, many moments compressed somehow into one."

- Kelsier

Preservation is a Shard of Adonalsium, one of the two located on Scadrial. Its original Vessel was Leras, but has since been held by Kelsier and Vin before Sazed took it and mixed it with Ruin, becoming Harmony. In the Terris religions Preservation is known as Terr, or "to preserve"; in Southern Scadrial, it's known as Frue and believed to be feminine. Preservation’s Investiture is typically associated with the color white.</description>

- Shallan to Iyatil

Shallan Davar, also known as Veil or Radiant, is a lighteyed Lightweaver of the Knights Radiant from Jah Keved. Shallan is an emerging scholar whose greatest achievement is the discovery of the legendary city Urithiru. She is also renowned for her extraordinary talent of accurately reproducing even fleeting scenes with photographic accuracy.

Hailing from a mid-level noble house in Jah Keved, Shallan lived a sheltered life on her father's estate until the age of seventeen, when she left to seek an apprenticeship under Princess Jasnah Kholin as a scholar. While acting as an apprentice to Jasnah Kholin, she became the causal betrothed of Jasnah's cousin, Prince Adolin Kholin, who she later married following the Battle of Thaylen Field. She also learns of and shares in Jasnah's quest to stop the mysterious and calamitous Voidbringers.

Shallan has a bond with the Cryptic Pattern, allowing her to manifest Pattern as a Shardblade and giving her access to her powers as a Surgebinder. Eventually, during the Battle of Narak, her bond with Pattern allowed her to become the first Lightweaver to be revealed as a Knight Radiant since the Recreance. She is bonded to a deadeye Cryptic named Testament as well and is able to summon her as a Shardblade in addition to Pattern</description>

- Szeth's thoughts on Shardblades

A Shardblade is a type of Invested weapon found on Roshar that is typically carried by the Knights Radiant and the Heralds of the Almighty. Shardblades wielded by Radiants are spren who have taken a physical form, and as such are Splinters of Shards Honor and Cultivation. They are usually used with Shardplate, Invested armor that also exists on Roshar, as Shardblades are so large that they are unwieldy on their own. Making use of a Shardblade is referred to as Shardwielding and those who are bound to a Shardblade are referred to as Shardbearers.</description>

      <description>Peter Ahlstrom is an employee of Dragonsteel Entertainment. He was formerly Brandon Sanderson's assistant and is currently Dragonsteel's editorial director.

Brandon has been known to describe Peter as "Incalculable", "Indivisible", "Insoluble", "Incandescent", "Inevitable", "Immaculate", "Inseparable", "Interpolated" and "Instant". Some of these adjectives make no sense, an in-joke that has persisted in Brandon's acknowledgements for years.

Brandon met Peter while attending Brigham Young University. Peter was an editor for several anime comics, including several for TOKYOPOP, before being hired by Brandon in 2007(ish).

Peter has several cameos in Brandon's work. There's "Ahlstrom Square" in Luthadel, "Ahlstrom Tower" in Elendel, Lieutenant Ahlstrom in Shadows of Self, and a "Lord Peterus" in Alloy of Law. In the Alcatraz series, the green jacket Alcatraz wears is actually Peter's green jacket. Peet, a member of Bridge Four, is also a cameo; Peet's fiancée Ka is a cameo for Peter's wife, Karen Ahlstrom. Peter is currently married with two children.</description>

Sel is a Shardworld of the cosmere and is the setting of the books Elantris and The Emperor's Soul, as well as the short story The Hope of Elantris.

Sel is inhabited by humans and artificially created beings called seons and skaze. This Shardworld is a relatively large planet, being 1.5 times the size of the cosmere standard, and contains diverse landscapes home to multiple great civilizations including at least three empires.

Another name for the planet is Seol. People from Sel are called Selish.</description>

      <description>The Reod was an event that occurred on Sel about ten years prior to the events of Elantris. The word Reod is based on Aon Reo which means punishment.

The Reod was a massive earthquake that created an enormous chasm in the south of Arelon. It altered the landscape to the point where the Aons used by Elantrians, which are based upon the landscape of Arelon, were no longer accurate. This caused all Aons to cease functioning, including the massive Aon Rao created by the city of Elantris and its surrounding cities, preventing the Elantrians from accessing Investiture, and afflicting them with an incomplete Shaod transformation. It was seen by Shu-Keseg and Shu-Dereth as a curse upon the Elantrians for their pagan ways.

Raoden is able to reverse or cure the Reod by adding "the chasm line" to the Aon Rao of Elantris, which allowed the Dor to flow properly again through the Aons, restoring the Elantrians and the Aons to their former glory.

The earthquake was not natural.</description>

 * This page contains information for the Shards of Adonalsium. For information regarding the armaments used on Roshar, see Shardblade or Shardplate.

"The Shards are not God, but they are pieces of God. Ruin, Preservation, Autonomy, Cultivation, Devotion...There are sixteen of them."

- Khriss

The Shards of Adonalsium, or Shards for short, are sixteen pieces of the power of creation. They are each named after a specific characteristic or ideal that represents the Shard's primary purpose or motivation. A person who has taken up the power of a Shard is the Vessel of that Shard.

The Shards are the most powerful known entities in the cosmere, and for all intents and purposes, serve as the gods of the cosmere. Most if not all magic systems are related to them.</description>

The Returned, who retain no memory of their previous existence, are worshipped as gods in Hallandren. The exact process of a Returned's resurrection is unclear; however, Lightsong had a Voice speak to him.. This voice is confirmed to be the Shard Endowment. The Voice gives people a glimpse into the Spiritual Realm, which let them see a possible future, she then offers a chance to Return and change the events of the vision.

Realmatic Theory refers to the study of the three Realms&mdash;Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual&mdash;that constitute the fundamental structure of the cosmere.

They are aptly named, as the terrain of the Plains consists of huge numbers of plateaus of various sizes, surrounded on all sides by deep chasms. It is unknown what caused the landscape to form this way, but during Kaladin's dream he saw the entire area as a symmetrical pattern, radiating outwards from the center as if something massive had struck there.</description>

      <description>"The Purelake seemed to extend forever, wide as an ocean... Rock outcrops broke the lake near the coast, but inward the Purelake grew placid, more empty."

- Szeth's description of the Purelake

The Purelake is a shallow inland lake located in north central Roshar. The people of the region are known as Purelakers and are ethnically Selay.

The Purelake is influenced, in some way, by Cultivation, although it predates her. It is unknown if she has a secondary perpendicularity in the Purelake.</description>

- Dalinar to Adolin

Ryshadium are a subspecies or breed of horse on Roshar. They are genetically distinct from other horses, though they are still capable of mating with them. They are likely descended from horses that were brought to Roshar when humans first arrived. They are often referred to as "the third Shard" in addition to a Shardblade and Shardplate.</description>

      <description>Sela Tales was one of the Silver Kingdoms on Roshar. It was a monarchy that claimed the Purelake, Marabethia, Babatharnam, Yulay and tiny portions of Tu Bayla and Rira as part of its territory.

The Oathgate within Sela Tales was located within Panatham. The monarchy of Sela Tales wrote in Dawnchant, the script of the Silver Kingdoms, though the people spoke an ancient form of the Selay language. At least one large stone fortress located on the Purelake was maintained by Sela Tales. Several sets of Shardblades and Shardplate remain under the ownership of the Selay.

The Selay people have distinctive ripple patterns on their skin.

Szeth was ordered by Taravangian to assassinate a Selay gerontarch.</description>

      <description>Safehand is an Alethi term for a woman's left hand. According to Vorin cultural tradition, it is improper for a woman to leave her safehand uncovered.

Upper-class women adhere to this tradition by wearing a sleeve that covers their left hand loosely. Often the sleeve has a safepouch sewn on the inside for women to store personal objects. It is considered extremely rude to open another woman's safepouch. Lower class women and women of non-Vorin or only nominally Vorin countries, such as Thaylen women, wear a glove so they can use both hands freely. Prostitutes often wear no covering at all or will wear fingerless gloves on their safehands in order to be provocative and show others who they are before being hired out.

The safehand derives from the book Arts and Majesty, which claimed that "true" feminine pursuits and arts were the ones that could be performed with one hand, while "manly" arts were the ones performed with two hands, thus tying delicacy with women and brute force with men.</description>

      <description>Sesemalex Dar is the capital of the kingdom of Emul on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

It is one of the most ancient cities in the world. It is said that the city--and the entire kingdom of Emul--was named by Jezrien himself. Some people such as Au-nak believe Sesemalex Dar is a Dawncity. The Emuli believe that Sesemalex Dar is their ancestral homeland and often proclaim of its religious significance.

The city of Sesemalex Dar sits on a stone plain on west coast of Emul, and borders on Tukar. It is northeast of Torriqqam.

The design of Sesemalex Dar is intricate and often said to be spectacular, built in enormous gashes in the ground to protect it from highstorms. Each trough has a lip of rock diverting water from flowing into the city and a complex drainage system of cracks to help it weather highstorms, as well stone of a unique composition that also helps with the drainage. The pattern of the Sesemalex Dar is central to the Emuli religion. The structure of the city is very similar to Yeddaw and many consider visiting Yeddaw to be the closest thing to seeing Sesemalex Dar itself.

The citizens of Sesemalex Dar are well known for their marvelous crem pottery and the city itself is a major waypoint and trade city of the south. Due to the wealth of trade in Sesemalex Dar, the bordering nation of Tukar wants the city and its fantastic port, which is the conflict at the root of the Eighty's War. As such the city has been a war zone for a long period of time.</description>

Holding a deep black sword that darkened the red sky around it."

- Lightsong seeing a painting of the Battle of Twilight Falls, with Shashara wielding Nightblood

Shashara was one of the Five Scholars on Nalthis.

Shashara's life before she Returned is a mystery. Upon her Return, she was named Glorysinger by the Cult of the Returned. She became one of the Five Scholars. Vasher indicates that she was one of the more talented Awakeners in the group. She was instrumental in the creation of the one-Breath Command to create Lifeless. Shashara is also the one who discovered how to create a sentient Awakened object of steel, leading to the creation of Nightblood.

She was the sister of Denth. Vasher and Shashara collaborated on their Awakening work, eventually marrying. Shashara and Vasher worked together to create the Command for Nightblood, "Destroy evil."

Nightblood mentions that she argued with Vasher, claiming that he could be a poet or scholar, like a man.

Shashara drew Nightblood the only time it was used in battle during the Manywar. While the details of the Battle of Twilight Falls has yet to be revealed, Vasher found the outcome to be horrifying enough to take action.

Vasher used Nightblood to slay Shashara, his own wife, when it became clear that she was going to reveal to the general populace how to create more sentient swords. She had already revealed the Command to create Lifeless from a single Breath, which was a contributing factor in the start of the Manywar.

She has traveled the cosmere and is considered an early cosmere scholar by those at Silverlight.</description>

The Pahn Kahl form a distinct but often overlooked group within the culturally dominant Hallandren, with a separate language and religion. They were formerly an independent country, but were absorbed into Hallandren after their defeat in the Manywar.

Giraffes inhabit the northern roughs, and acacia trees grow there.</description>

      <description>A painrial is a type of diminishing fabrial used to decrease and even eliminate the pain felt by someone while allowing them to maintain feeling.

The Artifabrian Longshadow designed a painrial that was quite large, about the size of a fist, and had a set of claw-like legs which were wrapped around the pained area and locked in place with a clip. That particular painrial was powered by a ruby and made of polished brass. Navani Kholin later refined its design. She hoped to eventually to refine the design to be less bulky. Navani saw it being used by surgeons so they could operate without fear of causing pain to their patients. While it did not heal the wounds, Navani hoped that the painrial was a step in the right direction.

Navani also integrated a painrial device into her timepieces which she made for herself and Dalinar. They offered some light pain relief and also could act as a defence mechanism, by releasing shocks into someone rather than taking their pain away. This function seemed to be toggled between using a switch made of gems.</description>

      <description>The Reshi Isles are a collection of islands on the northern edge of Roshar in the Reshi Sea. People from the Reshi Isles are called Reshi.

They include the islands of Kadrix, Quili, Abri, Arak and Sumi. According to Dalinar's memories the people of the Akak Reshi were destroyed.

One of the smaller islands is home to the ardents Geranid and her husband Ashir.</description>

      <description>"Shardplate wasn't merely armor. It was so much more."

- Dalinar

Shardplate is an ancient and magical type of full-body armor found on Roshar. Infused with the power of Stormlight, it enhances the strength, dexterity, and speed of the wearer. The precise origin of Shardplate was lost over time, though some believed that it was a gift from the Almighty. At least some of the ancient Knights Radiant gained it somehow upon swearing their order's Fourth Ideal. The power of Shardplate is provided by a continuous infusion of Stormlight from gemstones attached to the armor's interior, leading many modern Rosharans to believe that Shardplate may be some sort of fabrial. As Radiants returned it was discovered that Shardplate was formed of lesser spren associated with the Nahel Spren, for example windspren for honorspren, and that post-Recreance Shardplate was formed of the corpses of these spren. The first of the new Radiants to gain Shardplate was Jasnah Kholin. Gemstones began being added around the same time as they were added to Shardblades.

Contrary to dead Blades, which screams upon being touched by a Radiant, dead Plates emit a feel of satisfaction and doesn't feel as wrong as dead Blades.</description>

- Khriss on the Shattering

The Shattering of Adonalsium (or simply, the Shattering) was a pivotal moment in the history of the cosmere when Adonalsium was killed using the Dawnshards. Prior to this, there were no Shards, which have been the dominant influence in the cosmere we've seen so far. Brandon has stated that he currently imagines it to be about 6,000 years before the Stormlight Archive Prelude, or 11,000 years before The Way of Kings, but he might change his mind in the future.</description>

      <description>"I wouldn’t send my own brother ashore there without guards, and he’s killed seventeen men with his bare hands, he has."

- Tozbek on the Shallow Crypts

The Shallow Crypts is a port settlement on the southern edge of the Frostlands.

The Shallow Crypts is considered to be a very dangerous city by sailors who know it well. The city itself is unremarkable in appearance. It is surrounded by several similar sister cities in the same region. Due to the location of the Shallow Crypts, there is a commonly traveled corridor running through the sparsely populated Frostlands that connects the city with the Shattered Plains and the Alethi warcamps. Even in this corridor, it can be expensive to run a caravan to the Plains without sufficient wares. The people of the Shallow Crypts often trade slaves to caravans of merchants, who transport them to the Shattered Plains for sale. The city also does some trade by sea, managed by the harbormaster.

Tvlakv visited the Shallow Crypts in 1173 after selling Kaladin into slavery. The Wind's Pleasure intended to take port in the Crypts before it capsized after the attempt on Jasnah Kholin's life. Soon after leaving the city, Tvlakv's caravan intercepted Shallan after her ship sunk, and Shallan made him return to the Plains without much in trade beyond his slaves.</description>

The ruins of Rathalas are situated near the northern tip of the sea and Davinar lies on the western shore.

The sea is described as shallow, with rock formations jutting out of the water's surface. Adolin Kholin refers to it as a lake.

The Shadesmar counterpart of the Sea of Spears is an island that contains the major city of Celebrant.</description>

The Seran River cuts through the mountains, and a major railway line loosely follows the river's path. The city of New Seran is also close to the foothills of the mountains. The mountains have snow-capped peaks and are generally uninhabited due to their cold, stormy climate.

      <description>The Rose Empire is a nation on the same continent as, but separated by mountains from, Teod on Sel. The Rose Empire is ruled by the Emperor of Eighty Suns, who sits the Rose Throne. The reigning emperor during the time of Shai's imprisonment was Emperor Ashravan, the 49th Emperor of the Imperial dynasty. The lifespan of Rose Empire's dynasty is thus estimated to be within the range of 1000 to 3500 years at that point, given the lifespan of a Grand.

The Rose Empire maintains trade with the states of Sycla, but have a more strained relationship with Svorden. Svorden had sent a table as a gift to Emperor Ashravan's predecessor, but the poor relationship with Svorden caused the emperor lock it away.

They know of the concept of mass production, and used it in collusion with Remembering to create complex works in quantity.</description>

      <description>The Sands of Rashid are a type of sand considered mythical for many years which make the Translator's Lenses, granting an Oculator the ability to read, write, hear, or speak other languages.

The Sands were collected by Attica Smedry. He forged one pair of Translator's Lenses for himself and gave the rest to his son Alcatraz on his thirteenth birthday. Alcatraz's sands were smelted at the downtown library into a second pair of Translator's Lenses. Shasta gained possession of Attica's pair when he was transformed into a Curator of Alexandria.</description>

      <description>Rillir Roshone was a lighteyed Alethi on Roshar and the son of Brightlord Roshone.

He came to Hearthstone when his father became citylord following Brightlord Wistiow's death. He was courting Laral Wistiow.

When Lirin and Kaladin go to Roshone's manor to dine with him and discuss the spheres left to them by Wistiow, Kaladin is sent to the kitchen while the men discuss a deal. It is here that Kaladin sees Laral with Rillir, telling her about how he intends to take his father out on a hunt to brighten his spirits. He treats Kaladin like a serving boy and mentions his beliefs that as a lighteyes it is his place in life to be served and dictate to darkeyes how to serve him. He humiliates Kaladin until Laral redirects his attention.

Rillir suffered grevious wounds during a whitespine hunt, and was brought to Lirin and Kaladin for surgery. Lirin judged him to be beyond recovery, and made the decision to let him die on the surgery table.</description>

      <description>RAFO is a term Brandon Sanderson uses at signings as a non-answer for prying 17th Sharders. It means "Read and Find Out." When Brandon uses this, it is neutral, and neither means one is right or one is wrong. Many things are RAFO'd because they would spoil future books.

Robert Jordan popularized this term in this genre, and Brandon "inherited" it, so to speak. Brandon feels bad for simply stating "No, I won't answer.", so he has the RAFO cards made physically. Instead of saying it, he hand out the cards to the fans. It has become a trophy hunt for the fans.

RAFO can also be used as a response to questions that are meant to be discussed by fans or ones that will never be answered.</description>

      <description>The River Channerel is one of the main rivers in the Final Empire.

It flows from mountains in the east, providing the border of the Northern and Eastern Dominances, where it then goes into Lake Luthadel. From there, it runs directly through Luthadel, and continues down into the Southern Dominance, all the way into the sea.

In Luthadel it passes under six bridges, including the Old Wall Bridge in the north and Southbridge. A number of tributaries and canals flow into the river in the city and there are some docks and piers both in the center of the city near Kredik Shaw and closer to the city walls so boats can stop before going under bridges.

The residents of Luthadel used the river to dispose of waste, especially the ash collected by skaa.

The Luth-Davn Canal flows into the western bank of the river.</description>

Almost a fifth of the Originators were Terris.

During Sazed's ascension, he undid a lot of the changes that the Lord Ruler made to the genetics of the various peoples of the Final Empire. The survivors presumably had their bodies rewritten on the fly to remove differences between nobles, skaa, and the Terris peoples. This consigned these differences to the historical record.

MeLaan considered the originators to be "big-city people".</description>

      <description>The Rose Palace is the Imperial Palace of the Rose Empire on Sel and location of the Rose Throne. It was a vast establishment composed of many different wings. As each faction took control of the palace, they would choose which wings to utilize and maintain, leaving portions of the complex largely ignored at any given time. A new faction would often change the style and decorations completely to fit their desires and aesthetic. During the reign of Emperor Ashravan, the Heritage Faction made extensive use of Rememberers to recreate relics of the past. The central wings of the palace are made of quarried stone, and many rooms have stained glass windows installed. The palace is considered to be a beautiful structure, despite the many rooms left unused and the general disrepair of many sections.

Life in the Palace is strictly regimented. Post arrives early every morning, and servants go about their tasks like clockwork. The Strikers who serve as Palace guards are all required to be literate, as were any civil servants of the second reed or higher. The palace was often host to many notable personages, such as Atsuko of JinDo.</description>

Upon seeing Shaor, Raoden recognized her as Soine, the daughter of Duke Telrii who had claimed she died of dionia. She had been bald and had worn a wig of golden hair. When entering Elantris the priests had not bothered to remove the wig, thinking it was her real hair which had yet to fall out. Because of her supposedly golden hair, she was worshipped by men who had gone mad in Elantris.

When Raoden formed New Elantris and Shaor's men were restricted of their food supply from new Elantrians, they killed Shaor and took her wig to Raoden, to express their new allegiance to him.</description>

There is also a cave, and a large body of churning water. The Elendel Daily claims that precious and previously unknown metals are to be found there.

It is possible many Pahn Kahl joined in the Unity to oppose the Hallandren who had long occupied their land, hence the name of the coalition. It may have been referred to as a "unity" because the Pahn Kahl religion had five gods in a unity.

It may have included Gys, and almost surely included Tedradel.

The leader of the Pahn Unity was killed in the Battle of Twilight Falls.</description>

      <description>Peacegiver the Blessed left Hallandren and its priests with a vast store of at least fifty thousand Breaths: Peacegiver's Treasure, also called the Light of Peace.

The priesthood now believes that Peacegiver died when giving them the Breath, but that he may one day Return again to reclaim it. He gave the priests a commission: to protect the Breath, and never to use it. For this purpose, the priests created the succession of the God Kings--whenever an infant Returns, the priests believe this is a sign to change God Kings. They find a wife for the God King, preferring to use the child he fathers if possible; they take the child and cut out his tongue, then pass on the treasure of Breaths to the child, making him God King. However, if old God King fails to produce an heir, the stillborn infant Returned would be used as a backup plan.

The vast store of Breaths raises the God King to the Tenth Heightening, which is the secret to the old God King's ability to pass on his Breaths despite his missing tongue: at this Heightening, one can learn to give Commands mentally. This system essentially turns the God Kings into storehouses in order to fulfill the task left by Peacegiver. In addition, the priests provide each God King with two or more Breaths per week, steadily adding to the amount of Breath Peacegiver's Treasure actually contains.</description>

      <description>The Red Panther was a sailing vessel on Nalthis.

A man from Hallandren named Llarimar had a hobby of sailing. His brother Stennimar often joined him, and even gained some sailing skills through accompanying him. Llarimar borrowed the Red Panther and Stennimar joined him on a pleasure cruise. They were accompanied by some deckhands and Llarimar's family, including his daughter Tatara. A violent storm suddenly hit, and Tatara was swept overboard. Stennimar dove in after her and tied a rope around her leg so that she could be pulled up. However, he was pulled further underwater. He was unable to get back to the surface and drowned. This led to Stennimar becoming a Returned and Llarimar becoming his priest.

After Stennimar was resurrected as Lightsong the Bold, he did not remember his former life. He was surprised when he realized that he knew a number of sailing terms. He often saw ships and storms in his dreams or in abstract paintings, but he did not know why. He also had recurring nightmares about a red panther and a young woman's face fading into darkness. He even used "red panther" as a Lifeless Command phrase. He eventually regained his memory regarding the ill-fated ship.</description>

However, he was a very brave man, who did not hesitate to run into danger. Wax spoke of Paclo in a past tense, implying that Paclo was dead.</description>

He authored the book Seor's Encyclopedia of Political Myths, a treatise regarding the false rhetoric of Fjorden and the Derethi church. Sarene is fascinated by the book, and tells Raoden that it contains the original version of the poem Wyrn the King. The poem was later altered by Derethi priests to both falsely indicate that the original Wyrn was Derethi and to elevate Jaddeth from a minor god to the primary deity of Shu-Dereth. Sarene believes that the original version of the poem was suppressed by Fjorden, and would be a major embarrassment to them if it were publicized.</description>

      <description>Captain Orson Ansed is a member of the Evensong Police Department.

In 2211, a piece of carapace, presumed to be from the recently-missing Varvax ambassador, is found in a burning station on Evensong, and Ansed is assigned to investigate the case. When he first arrives at the scene, he receives a report from officer Ken Harris. He initially hopes to keep news of the incident from the media, but the worker who found the carapace had already released the information, and feels as though it might have been better if the burner hadn't been emptied for another couple of days so that the body could have been completely destroyed. When Jason Write arrives at the crime scene, Ansed assumes he had been sent by the Phone Company to investigate the death, though Jason actually came to retrieve a PC scientist, Denise Carlson, who appears to have gone crazy, and he allows the police department to continue to investigate.

He is not one to stand on formality, and waves away the salutes of officers working under him.</description>

      <description>Lieutenant Reddi is a constable in the 4th Octant constabulary district.

Reddi reported to Constable-General Brettin after the Vanishers raided the Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner. He told Brettin that High Lord Waxillium Ladrian and Wayne killed twenty-five members of the Vanishers and captured six. Reddi also told him that Lord Peterus was the only civilian killed, that Peterus had died prior to Wax's fight with the Vanishers, and that the other civilians escaped with only minor injuries. Reddi seemed to have a mix of awe and respect for Wax and his actions.

After Wax and Marasi's final confrontation with the Vanishers beneath the Ironspine Building, Reddi told Wax that Brettin had decided not to charge Wayne with impersonating an officers of the law. Reddi was confused by this choice, when before Brettin had seemed determined to keep Wax and Wayne out of his investigation on the Vanishers.</description>

      <description>The Outer Estates is the region immediately beyond the Elendel suburbs. It is a broad ring of orchards, fields and pastures that feed the city; this flora dwindles as one approaches the suburbs.

Wax found the quiet, peaceful atmosphere of the Outer Estates to be odd and boring, to the point that it made him somewhat uncomfortable and anxious when they went there to examine the site of the most recent Vanishers attack on train cars.

According to Lord Harms, his illegitimate daughter Marasi Colms had spent most of her life living in the Outer Estates before coming to the city to attend university.

When Wayne disguises himself as a House Tekiel guard so that Wax can sneak into the Breaknaught, he pretends to have spent most of his time in the Outer Estates serving a Lord Evenstrom Tekiel.

The Outer Estates are also where Edwarn and Telsin Ladrian faked their deaths to work with the Set; the story that made it to the public was that their horse bolted while were taking a carriage ride and the carriage went over a cliff. Presumably, such an accident did actually occur and was responsible for the death of their other family members, but Edwarn and Telsin managed to survive.</description>

      <description>Rambleman is the name given to some traveling merchants and peddlers on Nalthis. They are more than simple traveling jugglers or storytellers, as they specialize in bringing news (for a price) and stories alongside their goods and services.

Siri seems to have frequently listened to stories from ramblemen in her youth. She had various notions of Hallandren that were affected by these tales; she thought of it as a tropical, colorful land, but also a place of death with walls built of skulls painted in obscene splotches of color. She also heard tales of other grandiose cities and interesting terrain in distant countries such as Xaka and Hudres, although Hallandren was the only locale that was said to have a verdant jungle. The stories told by the ramblemen make her appreciate her small-town life in Idris. After arriving in Hallandren, Siri realized that the stories of the ramblemen were heavily embellished.</description>

- Khriss on the subject of shades

A shade is a type of Cognitive Shadow that is native to the Forests of Hell on Threnody. Spirits of dead Threnodites, the shades haunt the Forests preying on travelers and can only be defeated with silver. The shades are dangerous and feared by all inhabitants of the Forests, as their touch can cripple and disfigure and may even kill a person and turn them into a shade.</description>

Shalebark grows wild in such diverse locations as the relatively barren Shattered Plains and the jungles growing on the Tai-na in the Reshi Sea. It is also used extensively in landscaping across Roshar.

Shalebark is not a plant, but something more similar to coral.</description>

      <description>Prickletac or Twisted Spine is a type of plant native to the Shattered Plains of Roshar and other areas.

Only the buds at the very ends of the limbs of a prickletac shrub are actually alive. It is composed of a colony of tiny buds, each with a single retractable spine. Every new generation grows on top of the deceased generation below it. After a generation of prickletacs die, their remnants become stone-like, creating strong and inflexible limbs.

Prickletac spreads when a limb gets too heavy and breaks off. The living buds from the broken limb are scattered and form new plants.</description>

The River Vandonas is possibly a tributary of the Deathbend River, as it flows past where the Parshendi lived before the War of Reckoning, and Gavilar and Dalinar discovered the Parshendi while exploring a tributary of the Deathbend.</description>

The Rosharan system, also known as Greater Roshar, is the name given to the planetary system containing the Shardworld called Roshar. It comprises thirteen planets, three of which are inhabited, as well as the usual asteroid belt, and three moons for a total of sixteen orbital bodies -- an important number in the cosmere.</description>

      <description>The Outer Market was a market that grew up near the Pinnacle on the Shattered Plains of Roshar.

The Outer Market was usually ramshackle and poorly planned and organized. Nearly all the buildings were built from stone blocks quarried nearby. Most of the merchants who sold there were Thaylens. Many different shops had opened up in the Outer Markets, including multiple wine shops where Adolin Kholin sometimes spent time with his friends. The Outer Markets were one of the only places where people from multiple warcamps could mix, it was considered to be neutral territory.

The Outer Market was largely unregulated. As crime began to increase, Dalinar Kholin assigned a battalion of his troops to patrol the Outer Market and areas between the warcamps. These patrols weakened Dalinar's ability to go on plateau runs to capture gemhearts. Dalinar wondered whether the Outer Market would become more permanent as the Alethi solidified their control over the Shattered Plains.</description>

Every MaeDal, King Eventeo and Lord Eoden played ShinDa in Teod.</description>

He is the senior-most officer to survive the Battle of the Tower. A few months later, Rust receives his Shardplate from Adolin Kholin, who won them during his duels with the other highprinces' Shardbearers. During the Battle of Narak, Rust and Serugiadis, under the command of Teleb, fight at the head of Highprince Sebarial's army. As the armies retreat to the Oathgate at the end of the battle, Rust helps guide some of Dalinar's bridges into position to span the chasm.

He and Serugiadis practice with Shardbows in Urithiru on the day Dalinar first visits Azimir.</description>

A pain knife is able to inflict excruciating pain on the person it is used on by means of retractable blades that pierce an attacker's clothing. The blades can be set to four varying lengths to moderate the amount of pain inflicted. It has a removable covering so the fabrial gem can easily be infused with Stormlight.</description>

- =

Shadows Remembered was a book on Roshar full of children's tales about the Voidbringers. The unnamed female author had been curious about the folktales of the darkeyes and had spent years collecting them.

It was a thin, red book with a hogshide cover. It is likely an older work, as a copy is kept in the Palanaeum, shelved in the same room as Dialogues.

Shallan Davar noticed that Jasnah Kholin had been reading the book, piquing her interest; Shallan later visited the Palanaeum to look for it because she thought it would probably be a philosophical work about a historical murder. After finding the book, Shallan was disappointed by its seemingly mundane content. However, Jasnah's notes indicate that she did not dismiss any mythology about the Voidbringers, as there was always a possibility that folktales could contain elements of truth.</description>

      <description>The Reckoners are a group of freedom fighters on Earth. They fight the tyranny of the Epics.

Founded and lead by Jonathan Phaedrus(also known as Prof), they seek to neutralise as many high-profile Epics as they can. They employ stealth, trickery, and careful planning to overcome their vastly more powerful opponents. They explicitly avoid labeling themselves as revolutionaries; their goal is simply to bring retribution upon the worst Epics, not to rule in their place. They use advanced technology (as well as epic-based ones) and meticulous planning to take down Epics. They are also responsible for freeing the cities of Newcago, Babilar, and Ildithia.

They operate as many "cells", while the core cell lead by Prof does the killing, the other cells mainly provides information and assists with the scouting or logistics. The lesser cells are mostly kept secret from the epic-based technologies they use.

At various times, the Reckoners have been active in the Fractured States, Canada, and Mexico.</description>

- Shallan

Santhidyn are massive shelled marine animals native to Roshar. They are one of a few Rosharan species known to have some degree of sapience.

Santhidyn are so rare and reclusive that some scholars believe them to be extinct, although sailors sometimes sight them and dead specimens occasionally wash up on shore. There were no known pictures or reliable descriptions of live specimens until a santhid was observed and drawn by Shallan Davar.</description>

Kelsier didn't believe that Redd could have betrayed him, as he had been informed of the infiltration attempt at the last minute, and instead blamed Mare.

      <description>Lord Rian Strobe is a Noble in Luthadel.

At the Venture Ball he wore a green vest underneath a long dark suit coat. Rian is familiar with court etiquette, polite, and is confident enough to be the first person to approach a newcomer at a Luthadel ball.

He was the first suitor who approached Valette Renoux at Keep Venture and ask her to dance during her first ball. It is likely that he had been watching Vin while she ate, as he approached her soon after she finished her meal and addressed her by name. Vin declined his request to dance, expressing nervousness at attending her first ball, which Rian politely accepted before departing. As would have been expected within noble society, Vin's rebuff would not be treated like an outright refusal, and instead a postponement of the request, and it is likely that Vin danced with Rian at the next ball in which they were both in attendance.</description>

      <description>Lord Shewrman is an infamously bad party guest in Elendel.

Shewrman is a stocky man with long hair. He is a bore when sober, but he is usually a drunken buffoon. He is the least-likable person in the upper-society of Elendel, according to Lady Steris Harms.

He attends the Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner; his invitation was intended to be seen as an insult to those who did not receive one.</description>

- Rind to Kaladin

Rind is an Alethi man of the tenth dahn and the head quartermaster in the warcamp of Highprince Dalinar Kholin. He is a grizzled man with an enormous belly, which belied his surprisingly high pitched voice.

Rind gives Captain Kaladin and the men of Bridge Four their armor and the uniforms of the Cobalt Guard. However to Rind's dismay, the men want to remain Bridge Four, so they cut off the patches containing the insignia of the Cobalt Guard. Rind agrees to commission new patches for Bridge Four in the form of a glyphpair drawn by Kaladin.

Rind is surprised by Kaladin's rank of captain, claiming that he had never met a darkeyed captain, and perhaps there had never been one ever. However, he does not seem opposed to the idea. Rind also helps the men dress in their uniforms, as they were unaccustomed to wearing any clothing other than that of the bridgemen.

Rind later makes a rope ladder for Kaladin, so Kaladin could climb down to the chasms of the Shattered Plains. Rind initially is perplexed from the request, but constructs the ladder well.</description>

Revv is mentioned in Words of Radiance as the location of some disturbances which were quelled at the time of Nalan's acceptance of the Skybreakers' patronage.

"And thus were the disturbances in the Revv toparchy quieted, when, upon their ceasing to prosecute their civil dissensions, Nalan'Elin betook himself to finally accept the Skybreakers who had named him their master, when initially he had spurned their advances and, in his own interests, refused to countenance that which he deemed a pursuit of vanity and annoyance; this was the last of the Heralds to admit to such patronage."

      <description>Raymar place is a restaurant in T'Telir.

The restaurant is very dirty and lit only with natural light from small ceiling slats during the day. It serves a variety of fried food and is frequented largely by Grable's followers.

Denth and Vivenna visit there to meet with Grable, who owns the restaurant and runs a gang of thieves and thugs. Grable doesn't believe Vivenna is an actual princess, merely someone Denth is paying to imitate. He didn't take them up on their offer, instead making them leave after one of the thugs attacked them.</description>

      <description>Ridgebark is a commonly used stimulant on Roshar.

It is easy to acquire, even street urchins have access to ridgebark. They often chew it to keep themselves awake and alert when exhaustion or injury would ordinarily leave them incapacitated or unconscious.

Brightlord Adolin Kholin chewed ridgebark to stay awake while guarding his father's room through the night after Szeth's assassination attempt. Teft used it in an analogy to casual usage of firemoss compared to his addiction.</description>

Milen Davenpleu and Lords Rene and Tyden played the game together. Milen once failed to show up to a scheduled outing, preventing the game from proceeding. During a ball at Keep Hasting, Milen had an obligator witness his promise to play the next day in order to reassure the other men that he would not brush them off again.</description>

- The Book of False Dawn, written by Deluse Couvre

The Renates were a people on Scadrial.

In the near past, the Lord Ruler relocated the Renates peoples. In The Book of the False Dawn, Deluse Couvre regards their relocation as a colossal leadership error. While most of the Lord Ruler's mistakes have been covered up and can only be found in a Keeper's metalminds or in obscure, forbidden texts, the relocation of the Renates is known because of its recency.</description>

When the Aonic peoples migrated to Arelon they found Elantris empty and abandoned. Initially it was viewed with superstition, people believed it was haunted. King Rhashm, who renamed himself Raoshem, strove to overcome the fears of his people and settled Elantris as the center of his kingdom. Several decades later people started being taken by the Shaod, becoming Elantrians.</description>

      <description>Rick O&#39;Shea is an Irish Epic that can make objects unstable through touch, which then explode under any significant impact. A gauss gun, which Abraham purchased from Diamond, replicated his power by charging up a bullet and turning it into an exploding projectile. Diamond says he is a standard kinetic energy Epic.

Abraham dislikes this Epic's name due to it being a pun on the French word ricochet, comparing it to "something Cody would say."

David Charleston notes that Rick O'Shea was a newer Epic, and so wasn't one of the Epics in the old days that was imprisoned and experimented on. David wonders, then, if such research still occurs.</description>

David Charleston once heard a rumor that Jonathan Phaedrus (Prof) had killed Redleaf by shooting him in midair after jumping out of a moving airplane. When David mentioned this story to Abraham, however, Abraham revealed that he was present for the operation and that the rumors were exaggerated. Prof's actions were pre-planned, and he had actually jumped from a helicopter.</description>

      <description>Patji's Eye is an emerald lake on the island of Patji.

It is the home to the symbiotic worm which gives the Aviar their cognitive talents. Aviar come to Patji's Eye when they are young to gain their talent. The worms feed off of the fruits of Patji's Finger, which only grow on Patji, and the Aviar gain the symbiont by eating the worms. The lake conceals the minds of those in its vicinity, allowing them to hide from predators who hunt by seeking out consciousness.

The trappers know about Patji's Eye and what the Aviar do there, but they do not go there often.

It is a natural manifestation of Investiture and is much smaller than most others found in the cosmere. It serves as a perpendicularity in the Drominad System.</description>

In addition to the ability to hold Stormlight, Polestones are able to trap spren. The type of spren that can be trapped depends on the Polestone used and its cut. This quality serves as the basis for fabrials. Each Polestone is associated with one of the Ten Essences and with an Order of Knights Radiant.</description>

      <description>Sazed's Rings are a set of ten small Feruchemical metalminds utilised by Sazed.

The ten were put into use in preparation for and during the Battle of Luthadel, where Sazed took an instrumental role in the capital's defense. Not much charge was contained, as he was forced to fill as much as he could in only a few days before the battle. Although they did not see any use in Sazed's fight against the koloss, the rings were what allowed him to incapacitate Marsh after the Steel Inquisitor assaulted him, saving Sazed's life as a result.

The rings survived Sazed's ascension to Harmony after the Battle of Hathsin, and may play a role in later books.

Four were tin, (sight, hearing, scent, and touch) and the other six were pewter, gold, zinc, steel, bronze, and iron.</description>

      <description>A shardhammer, also known as a warhammer is an enormous battle hammer that can only be wielded by someone in Shardplate. Contrary to what it's name might suggest, it is not an ancient magical weapon like Shardplate or a Shardblade, but rather, a more modern creation. Dalinar's warhammer is described as having a haft as "thick as a man's wrist" with the front of the head being larger than a man's fist. It could barely be lifted by two men and was carried on a cart. A Shardbearer's hammer is a common weapon for someone who owns a set of plate, but no Shardblade.</description>

      <description>Puños de Fuego (Spanish for Fists of Fire) is an Epic based in Hermosillo, Mexico.

He has super strength and can lift practically anything, even things that ought to break apart as he does so. He has enhanced endurance and thick elephant-like skin, but is not a High Epic. He is killed in a hit by the Reckoners; though he avoids Sam, somehow figures out where their operations station is, and breaks it open by throwing a tank through the wall, he is killed by Val, who gets in the tank and shoots him with its main gun. Sam later finds his arm seven streets away.

This encounter seems to have gained some notoriety among Reckoners, as David immediately asks Val if she was in the job in Hermosillo after learning she had been stationed in Mexico.</description>

      <description>Roy is a member of Enforcement and an acquaintance of David Charleston.

Roy is one year older than David and was raised in the Havendark Factory alongside him. The Factory's manager, Martha, assigned Roy the role of "adjunct", which required him to help supervise the younger children and deal with conflicts and bullying. David respected him for performing this role.

After graduating from the Factory, Roy joined Enforcement. He and Refractionary were part of the Enforcement Core that searched David's apartment when he became a suspect in the assassination of Fortuity. When David returned to his apartment and was accosted by Enforcement, Roy believed that David was innocent and tried to persuade his commander to let him go. When the Reckoners engaged the Enforcement Core in combat and killed several of them, David spared Roy and told him that he was part of a conspiracy led by an Epic called Limelight, thus throwing Enforcement off of the Reckoners' trail.

After Steelheart was killed, Roy continued to serve as an Enforcement officer, helping to maintain order in the liberated Newcago. He and David remained on good terms.</description>

- Adolin

The Right of Challenge is a Vorin tradition said to have been created by the Heralds. It can be offered to any lighteyed warrior who has proven themselves -- usually himself -- before the Almighty and the king.

The Right of Challenge allows a person to demand justice through combat from someone who wronged them. Many lighteyes know of the tradition, but it is ignored in modern circumstances. The Right of Challenge, used in conjunction with the King's Boon, has been used twice in Alethkar's recent history: once by Prince Adolin Kholin against Highprince Torol Sadeas, and once by Sadeas against Highprince Yenev eighteen years earlier. It was also used by Kaladin against Meridas Amaram, despite the former being a darkeyes, though his attempt landed him in prison.</description>

- Bleeder speaking in Wax's head for the first time.

Paalm was a female kandra of the Third Generation. She was an agent of Harmony sent to protect Waxillium Ladrian in the Roughs, under the guise of a human woman, Lessie.

Sometime after Lessie's supposed death, she chose to remove one of her Hemalurgic spikes. She used only a single spike at a time to avoid being under Harmony's influence. She used spikes of a metal unknown even to Harmony to grant herself Allomantic and Feruchemical powers. During that time she went by the alias Bleeder. She colluded with the Set to execute a plot to free Elendel from Harmony's influence.

She ultimately committed suicide to avoid being taken control of by Harmony after she was shot by Wax with a second Hemalurgic spike.</description>

A perpendicularity is a stable junction between the Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual Realms. They are used by worldhoppers such as Hoid to go from planet to planet. They are formed through the concentration of Investiture. Because of this, they are most commonly found at places where a Shard's power is focused, often in the form of a pool of liquid. A Shard can control where their perpendicularity manifests.</description>

Rame has previously corresponded with Hanlanaze and planned to study electrical fields himself.

      <description>Replar Innate was the corrupt Governor of Elendel. At some point before the events of Shadows of Self, he was murdered by the kandra Paalm and impersonated by her. Paalm used his noble likeness to sow unrest in the city's working class. When his brother Winsting Innate, a member of the Elendel senate, was killed in his own mansion by Paalm, riots broke out in the already-tense streets of Elendel.

During the hunt for Paalm, Waxillium Ladrian forced her to abandon Innate's bones. MeLaan then took his bones and attempted to quell the riots in a speech in front of the Governor's Mansion. During the speech constable Claude Aradel placed the impersonated Innate under arrest for corruption. MeLaan then staged a suicide of Innate while in jail.

Innate was succeeded by Aradel as Elendel Governor.</description>

Razal does not have the elongated features that are associated with the Terris of pre-catacendre Scadrial, however, he may have the height or darker skin coloring that has been passed down from the Terris Originators.

He is a Ferring, with the powers of a Brute - the ability to Feruchemically charging pewter metalminds, which he can then later tap to increase his physical strength. He is in charge of two other Brute guards and the three are responsible for removing trespassers from the Village. He is a stubborn person - an attribute that is likely an aid in his duties as guard. However, despite his stubborn nature he is still respectful of Terris leadership and customs. He does not recognize Wax as being Terris from his appearance, however, has heard of him before and is aware that he is Vwafendal's grandson.

Razal confronts Wax when he entered the Village to speak with his grandmother about the death of Lord Winsting and his associates, attempting to force Wax to leave. Vwafendal interrupted the confrontation and advised that Wax could freely enter the Village due to his Terris heritage.</description>

A glowstone is a large, porous rock which perchwither grows on. TenSoon noted that the Trustwarren did not use glowstone for its light, instead being lit with oil lamps with blue glass.

It is possible that this is related to glowpaste on Threnody.</description>

      <description>The Physical Realm is the realm of existence in the cosmere that contains what is perceivable to the physical senses. Of the three Realms, it is the most readily understood, as it behaves in much the same way as our universe does.

Most of the cosmere stories so far take place almost exclusively in the Physical Realm. These stories are set on planets orbiting stars that are part of a small cluster within a dwarf galaxy.

This article lists all the known celestial bodies in the cosmere as they appear in the Physical Realm, including planets, stars and moons.</description>

      <description>ReLuur is a third generation kandra. There are very few third generation kandras, and many kandra looked up to him.

He is an explorer and pursues knowledge of the Bands of Mourning. Along the way, he took many evanotypes of murals and images that depicted the Bands of Mourning, suggesting that they did in fact exist. However, when he returned to the Kandra Homeland, he was missing one of his two Hemalurgic spikes, and as a result was not entirely sane. TenSoon attempted to give ReLuur one of his spikes, but as it was another kandra's spike, he rejected it and spat it out.

He found the Set and Telsin Ladrian.

ReLuur's spike is pewter, a metal which is not normally used as a Blessing.</description>

      <description>The Royal Archives (Not a Library!) is a building in the capital of Nalhalla that houses a huge mountain of books collected by Free Kingdoms scribes. Due to its similarity to a library and Free Kingdomers' loathing of libraries, whenever it is mentioned, "not a library" always follows.

Prior to Alcatraz's arrival, the Royal Archives (Not a Library!) featured a disorganized heap of books. This mess frustrated Alcatraz and he had Himalaya organize the books.

The Royal Archives (Not a Library!) is protected by Defender's Glass, so instead of tunneling inside, Shasta placed Transporter's Glass around it, essentially stealing the whole Archive to grab a book written in the Forgotten Language. Containing the lost knowledge of Smedry Talents and their origins, the book is extremely important -- and was in fact the book Attica needed to discover how to give Smedry Talents to everyone.</description>

      <description>OreSeur is a kandra from Scadrial.

His contract is with Kelsier at first. He mainly imitates Lord Renoux and keeps an eye on Vin while she acts as Valette Renoux. Upon Kelsier's death, his contract is passed to Vin, who distrusts him because he ingested Kelsier's body in order to imitate it and address the skaa warriors in accordance with his contract. Eventually, Vin’s disgust at the idea of a kandra eating humans drives her to order OreSeur to ingest the bones of a wolfhound instead. Mid-transformation, he is secretly killed and replaced by TenSoon.

His contract was assigned to Kelsier by KanPaar even though it would be to act against the Lord Ruler due to the high price Kelsier was willing to pay for it.

Like TenSoon, he was of the third generation of Kandra and thus over 700 years old.</description>

- Kenton

Sand mastery is a manifestation of Investiture on the Dayside of Taldain, where the Diem recruits and trains sand masters. It involves manipulation of white sand at the cost of the user's internal water supply. In addition, white sand that has been manipulated will turn black, becoming unresponsive. Black sand turns white again after four hours of sun exposure.</description>

The cemetery's gates are topped with a statue of the Survivor. There is also a statue of the Ascendant Warrior placed at the paupers' section of the graveyard.

There are two known gravekeepers employed at the cemetery. Dechamp runs the night shift while Bilmy runs the day shift.

When ReLuur visits New Seran, an explosion in the city hits him, blowing a chunk of his body off, including one of his spikes. This spike is mixed with the corpses of the people killed in the explosion, which are subsequently buried in the Seran New District Cemetery. Templeton Fig later retrieves the spike upon orders of the Set.</description>

      <description>The Royal Locks are a hereditary trait of the Royal House of Idris on Nalthis.

Members of the Royal House can change their hair color or cause their hair to grow quickly at will. Normally the color of the Royal Locks reflects the person's emotional state by default but this can be controlled through training and discipline. The ability to grow hair at will takes effort and leads to hunger and exhaustion.

Only members of the Royal House that are potential heirs to the throne have and can pass on the Royal Locks.</description>

      <description>The Party in Babilar occurred during the Reckoners' campaign against the Epic Regalia in Babilar.

David Charleston went there following Mizzy and Exel. He described it as chaotic like a riot. There were vivid colours everywhere as all the dancers were wearing clothes with luminescent painted colours on them. The music was so loud as to make talking difficult. It was extremely crowded and it made David feel defensive.

At this party Mizzy introduces David to some Babilar residents that she knows: Infinity, Marco, Lulu and Calaka.

Newton was present at the party. She left part-way through, leading to David following her and eventually hiding from her after she realizes that she was being followed. She started looking for David after the party but didn't find him.</description>

The Salavashi Trench is a portion of the Sea of Oracles.

In the Physical Realm, the Sea of Oracles corresponds to at least parts of Alethkar north of the Deathbend River. It is also north of the Tarat Sea, so it seems the Sea of Oracles goes into Jah Keved. The sea's western boundary is unclear.</description>

It was abandoned by the bank prior to or during the Siege of Kholinar and then been occupied by Velalant to use as a distribution point for food and supplies during the siege. Veil visited to investigate the Velalant operation, and noticed that it was badly organised and actively excluded those who needed the grain in favour of giving it to servants from lighteyed households. Whilst surveilling, she met Grund, who told her about the failures of Velalant's charity.</description>

      <description>Oroden is the youngest child of Lirin and Hesina, and Kaladin's baby brother.

Oroden, along with the rest of the people of Hearthstone, was sheltered in Roshone's manor when the True Desolation came to Roshar.

Kaladin estimates him to be about a year old when he meets him for the first time. His name means 'child of peace'.

Oroden was later relocated to Urithiru with the population of Hearthstone, where he lives on the sixth floor with his parents, sleeping in a small closet. Kaladin visits and plays with him at least once.

When Urithiru is assaulted by Odium's forces, Oroden was initially taken care of by a 'village girl', presumably from Hearthstone. Oroden is present when soldiers come to take fallen Radiants from Lirin's care into custody, and begins crying when after Kaladin kills the Regal in protection of Teft. After this, Lirin, Hesina and Oroden are imprisoned in the the clinic, held by Lezian's guards, and later by Leshwi's after Venli intervenes. The family stays together when Lirin and Hesina begin looking after the fallen Radiants.</description>

      <description>Rembrinor is a swordmaster from Alethkar on Roshar.

Dalinar Kholin asked Kadash if he had ever told him the story of his first sword trainer. Kadash guessed that it was Rembrinor, but it was actually Harth. Rembrinor may be an ardent, as Dalinar alludes to additional sword training that he later received at monasteries on Kholin land.</description>

- Patji

Patji is an avatar of Autonomy located on First of the Sun. Patji wrote the second letter in Oathbringer.

At some point Patji was a being of its own, with unknown amounts and origins of Investiture, somehow related to Autonomy. Autonomy sensed it and shaped it into an avatar.

Patji was directly created by Autonomy and is strongly connected to Autonomy.</description>

      <description>The rtich is an epic-based technology in The Reckoners' world.

Like most of the epic-based technologies, it requires much training and practicing to use. The device is a glove that can manipulate mercury to form various shapes. Since mercury isn't very common, the user usually must carry it around in order to use its power. A thin layer of mercury it creates is able to stop bullets.

It is derived from the Epic of the same name, Rtich.</description>

In the book, Jasnah postulates that all of the Silver Kingdoms of Roshar used a common writing system known as the Dawnchant during the Heraldic Epochs, even though there were many different languages spoken. Two ardents at the Jokasha Monastery, Ellista and Urv, discuss Relic and Monument as it relates to their work translating ancient Dawnchant texts.

Ellista agrees with Jasnah's theory, and believes that the use of Dawnchant as the standard scholarly writing system eventually broke down when people started phonetically transcribing their own spoken languages in Dawnchant script. This led to the development of new writing systems, and knowledge of the Dawnchant was gradually lost to time and Desolations.</description>

The vast majority of worlds in this universe are unstable shadows. However, the few stable worlds, the Core Possibilities, are mostly undergoing catastrophes, including Reckoners' world. To save these worlds, the Apocalypse Guard is founded.</description>

- Blaze to Arturo.

A scout is a position that can be held by pilots in the DDF. Cadets train with scouts during their time at Flight School and have the option to become a scout after they graduate. There are at least fifteen scouts in the DDF, including FM; however, three are killed in the initial firefight and nine by a lifebuster bomb, during the Battle of Alta Second. During this battle, instead of being organized in larger squads, the scouts were split into five trios. The three scouts that survive the lifebuster return to Alta with Riptide Flight to aid Spensa, Kimmalyn, Nedd, and Arturo in defending the base from the second Krell attack.</description>

      <description>Remark is a cadet in either Inkwell Flight or Firestorm Flight who is offered a scout position prior to graduation. As a scout he would fly a Val-class ship. It is unclear whether Remark is a callsign or this cadet's name.

He is boisterous and has a bowl cut. He is excited to join the scouts after graduating from Flight School and talks with the other cadets about his offer during dinner in the mess hall.

The current status of Remark is unknown, however, if he did graduate he may have been one of the twelve scouts combined into a single Flight during the Second Battle of Alta. As three quarters of this Flight were killed during the fight, he may now be dead.</description>

      <description>"My name is Alanik of the UrDail. I'm a pilot and messenger from the planet… From the planet ReDawn."

- Spensa pretending to be Alanik

ReDawn is the homeworld of the UrDail.

Very little is known about it. The atmosphere is breathable for humans, although it has a distinct smell, both floral and acrid. The entire world is ruled by a single government, the Unity of UrDail, a client state, but not a member, of the Superiority. It seems to have no singular leader, but rather a group of UrDail making decisions as a collective. Cytonics are extremely rare there, with Alanik being the only citizen with the ability.

During the Third Human War, ReDawn was allied with humanity, though in the current times, this period is called an occupation by the Unity. As a result, some of the locals speak fluent Mandarin and English, and the native language has come to resemble the latter. It has also raised some doubts within the Superiority as to whether the UrDail were fit to join them.</description>

- Rlain

Rhythms are a cosmere-wide phenomenon that manifests most clearly on Roshar. They're a variety of beats or melodies that change in regular ways over time. They are not normally audible; Singers and larkin are the only known species able to hear the rhythms, though others exist throughout the cosmere.</description>

      <description>"[I]s that what women are supposed to seek in a mate? Is it in the Polite Lady's Handbook to Courtship and Family? The Bekenah edition, maybe? 'Ladies, you can’t possibly marry a man if he can’t fly.'"

- Shallan Davar to Adolin Kholin

The Polite Lady's Handbook to Courtship and Family is a book on Roshar. At least one edition was written by a woman named Bekenah.

After the Battle of Thaylen Field, Adolin Kholin tried to call off his engagement to Shallan Davar and "let Kaladin] have" her, saying he believed she would be happier with Kaladin, based on the looks she had given Kaladin while in her Veil persona and Kaladin's ability to fly. Shallan, however, had realized how much they loved each other, and sarcastically asked Adolin if there was a requirement that a women give precedence to someone who could fly when looking for someone to marry, suggesting that it might be in the Bekenah edition of the Polite Lady's Handbook to Courtship and Family.</description>

      <description>Shash can be three different things:
 * A letter in the alphabet used in Hallandren on Nalthis.
 * On Roshar, shash is the name of two different glyphs:
 * See Glyphs/Index for the glyph used for the Herald Shalash, the Order of Lightweavers, and the number six. As the number six, shash is also used as the name for the sixth month of the Rosharan calendar as well as the name of the sixth gas giant from the sun of the Rosharan system.
 * See Glyphs/Index for the glyph meaning "dangerous" that was branded onto Kaladin's forehead.</description>

      <description>"Why do we need warships? The Basin is alone on land and on seas. From whom do we need protection?"

- Inis Julien, quoted in The New Ascendancy

The Pewternaut is a class of steel-hulled warships from Scadrial. They were developed by Lord Mayor Bastien Severington of Bilming along with Dr. Florin Malin around 342.

They are heavily-armored warships with reinforced hulls, electronic range-finders, and a total armament of sixteen 12-inch naval artillery guns, with a range of 16 miles. They are capable of reaching a top speed of 24 miles an hour. The Pewternaut represented a significant technological advancement compared to the clipper ships typically in use around the Basin.

Senator Inis Julien and other members of a delegation from Elendel that were invited to the unveiling of the ships publicly mocked them as unnecessary. This likely contributed to growing anti-Elendel sentiment in other cities, some of it incited by Lord Severington.</description>

      <description>The Reeve Playhouse is a theater in Newcago owned by Spritzer. It is located on Schuster street, and has a bright red neon sign that proclaims the name of the theater. The majority of people who went to the Reeve Playhouse would be rich overstreeters, either favored by Steelheart or simply born to a rich family.

On the first Saturday of every month, Fortuity would go there to see a play. During the fight with Fortuity, Tia blew the Reeve up, in an attempt to lead Fortuity back to the area the Reckoners wanted him in.</description>

Riino's lighthouse can be found at the end of a peninsula within the Sea of Lost Lights in Shadesmar.

The lighthouse functions as a waypoint in which passing ships can restock their supplies, as well as signalling that there is land nearby. The dwelling is also used by Riino to conduct readings of the future for passing travellers.</description>

      <description>"Kill him."

- Ruin to Zane

"I am FREE!"

- Upon Ruin's release.

""Ah, Vin," Ruin said, its voice almost fatherly in tone. "You act as if I were your enemy."

"You are my enemy. You seek to end the things I love."

"And is an ending always bad?" it asked. "Must not all things, even worlds, someday end?""

- Ruin to Vin.

"Do not mourn because the day of this world's end has arrived. That end was ordained the very day of the world's conception. There is a beauty in death--the beauty of finality, the beauty of completion.

For nothing is truly complete until the day it is finally destroyed."

- Ruin to Vin.

"There was one good thing about Ruin's voice--it tended to warn her when people were nearby, even if it did always tell her to kill them."

- Vin's thoughts about Ruin.

"You still don't understand, I see. You're all on my side, Vin. I created you. You're my tools--each and every one of you. Zane, Yomen, you, your dear Emperor Venture..."

- Ruin taunting Vin.

"This process we are engaged in, the end of all things—-it's not a fight, but a simple culmination of inevitability. Can any man make a pocket watch that won't eventually wind down? Can you imagine a lantern that won't eventually burn out? All things end. Think of me as a caretaker—-the one who watches the shop and makes certain that the lights are turned out, that everything is cleaned up, once closing time arrives."

- Ruin taunting Vin.

"You are a piece of me, you know. Beautiful destroyer. Blunt and effective. Of all those I've claimed over this brief thousand years, you are the only one I think just might be able to understand me."

- Ruin to Vin.

"The only point in creating something is to watch it die."

- Ruin to Vin.

"Those quakes are the earth's final sighs," Ruin said. "Like an old man, moaning as he dies, calling for his children so that he can pass on his last bits of wisdom."

- Ruin to Vin

"That's the way it must always be, as I told you. When men think they are helping the world, they actually do more harm than good. Just like you. You tried to help, but you just ended up freeing me."

- Ruin to Vin

"You can't fool me, Vin, I am God."

- Ruin to Vin

"For Ruin, there is Preservation. Time immemorial! Eternity! And each time I push, YOU push back. Even when dead, you stopped me, for we are forces. I can do nothing! And you can do nothing! Balance! The curse of our existence."

- Ruin to Vin after her ascension.

"Balance, Ruin spat. Balance imprisoned me. Preservation's sacrifice--that was to siphon off the part of me that was stronger, to lock it away, to leave me equal with him again. For a time.

Only for a time. And what is time to us, Vin?

Nothing."

- Ruin to Vin as she tries to get a message to Elend.

"Opposition. Balance. You'll learn to hate it, I suspect, though Preservation never could."

- Ruin to Vin as she first attacks Ruin directly and withdraws.

"I can't decide if you're a fool, or if you simply exist in a way that makes you incapable of considering some things."

- Vin to Ruin as Elend fights the koloss.

"How do you like that! I killed him! I Ruined everything you love! I took it from you!"

- Ruin to Vin as he kills Elend

"He gave up his power at the Well, and into the mists, giving it to us so that we could take it. He always intended this to happen. You think this was your plan? It was his. His all along.

You created the thing that can kill you, Ruin. And you just made one huge final mistake. You shouldn't have killed Elend.

You see, he was the only reason I had left to live."

- Vin's last words.

"You realize the forces I can bring to bear against you, child? You realize the power I have, the destruction I represent? I am mountains that crush. I am waves that crash. I am storms that shatter. I am the end."

- Ruin to Vin.</description>

It is a game played by the singers Khen and Sah, as well as by some of their previous masters. Kaladin has also played it. Sah's set of wooden, lacquered cards is of Herdazian make. Cheaper, less durable cards are available, although they warp in the rain.</description>

      <description>Pilevine is a plant on Roshar.

Pilevine produces red fruits with a stringy texture. They are eaten by Alethi soldiers on the Shattered Plains. When the fruit becomes overripe, some of the soldiers throw them at bridgemen. During his time in Bridge Four, Moash was hit in the face by a pilevine fruit.</description>

      <description>"Pardon, but you did what any good rebsk would do. A rebsk worthy of this crew."

- Captain Drlwan to Rysn

Rebsk is a term for a shipmaster or owner in Thaylenah. The rebsk owns the ship according to its documentation, but it is another matter to earn the respect of the crew itself. The position creates a distance between the rebsk and the crew, who view their rebsk as "more unapproachable than an officer." Traditionally, the rebsk begins any voyage by taking a turn at the helm; however, this privilege is only extended to the rebsk by the captain after the rebsk has proven himself or herself to deserve the esteem of the crew, sometimes an undertaking that requires years of interaction. It is also within the rebsk's rights to give orders to the crew, though this could potentially upset the balance of respect and power if the crew does not yet regard their rebsk very highly. When present on the ship, the captain defers to the rebsk in matters of planning the route and any on-shore expeditions and even asks for an indication that the voyage can officially begin.</description>

      <description>Screech is a pet skyeel kept by the crew of the Wandersail. Screech was well-liked by the crew and hunted rats onboard for them. During the voyage to Akinah, Screech was killed by Nikli in one of his attempts to frighten the crew into turning back by creating bad omens. Screech's death indeed gave the crew pause due to their superstitions stemming from the Passions, but they pressed on since their orders came directly from Queen Fen.

Nikli used blackbane to kill Screech. He later tried to frame Cord for the skyeel's death, but Rysn figured out that he was the true culprit.</description>

- Vstim about Jasnah

Sea hags are unspecified creatures in Thaylen mythology. They are considered fictitious by most Rosharan scholars as well as modern Thaylens, alongside gloomdancers and living heaps of cremlings. However, as the latter have been proven to exist, it's unknown if the sea hags are pure fiction, real fact, or folk interpretation of real beings.

Vstim mentions them to Rysn when talking about Queen Jasnah's research into the Sleepless.</description>

      <description>Rhythm of War is the name Navani and Raboniel chose to give the shared notebook they maintained, while experimenting with the different Lights of Roshar. It was symbolically named after the Rhythm of War to represent Honor and Odium working together, if only for a short time. Raboniel had a copy of this book made for Navani, while the original was sent to Kholinar, as she wanted the discoveries made by them to give both sides the tools to finally end the war.

The Fused scholar of human art forms, El, later uses the original notebook to replicate their work, and kills Lezian permanently to test it out.</description>

      <description>The Radiant Depths is a trench in the Sea of Souls, part of the Rosharan subastral of the Cognitive Realm. It is south of Nohadon's Stairways, and is likely named after the Knights Radiant. It is east of a peninsula where the lighthouse Abiding Light is located, and north of Nameless.

In their expedition to Lasting Integrity, Shallan and Adolin travel through the Radiant Depths to get to Nameless.

The Radiant Depths correspond at least to Marat in the Physical Realm, and possibly other nations to the east.</description>

An Allomancer burning steel can Push bits of metal away from their "center of self," and can also use steel to sense the presence of metal nearby. Steelpushing is not dependent on magnetic forces or Allomatic power--most metals (with the exception of aluminum and some of its alloys) can be Pushed. Feruchemists can use steel to store physical speed, and when used as a hemalurgic spike, steel steals Physical Allomantic powers.</description>

      <description>"What a gift you gave them! Time to recover, for once, between Desolations. Time to progress. They never had a chance before. But this time ... yes, maybe they do."

- Taln

Talenel, known as Talenelat'Elin in Vorinism and nicknamed Taln or Talat, is one of the ten Heralds of the Almighty and patron of the Order of Stonewards. He's often titled the Herald of War, or the Herald of Soldiers. At Aharietiam, he was abandoned by the rest of the Heralds and forced to return to Damnation alone.

      <description>The Steel Ministry is the religion and the government bureaucracy of the Final Empire. It is made up of various divisions, named Cantons, and the members of the Ministry are called obligators. The Inquisitors are also part of the Steel Ministry.

One of the main functions of the Ministry is to witness a myriad of contracts and agreements, even something as simple as promise to come to a game of shelldry. The nobility pay the Lord Ruler for their services in a manner similar to that of renting skaa. As the authority in bureaucratic matters, any mercantile contracts, divorces, weddings, land purchases, inheritances, or any other important dealings could only be authorized by obligators. If one of the Ministry hasn't witnessed an event or sealed a document, it might as well not have happened or have been written.</description>

      <description>The skaa are a race of humans on Scadrial.

The skaa were effectively created by the Lord Ruler when he forcibly divided the people of the world. Skaa are descendants of the people who did not support the Lord Ruler during his rise to power, unlike the. During his Ascension, the Lord Ruler altered the physiology of people. The majority of the people he changed became skaa; built to be shorter, hardier, and more fertile. These physical differences were small, and have mostly been erased by noble and skaa interbreeding over the thousand years of the Final Empire's history. All skaa Allomancers are the result of noble and skaa blood mixing during some point in the person's heritage.</description>

      <description>"Spren appear when something changes—when fear appears, or when it begins to rain. They are the heart of change, and therefore the heart of all things."

- Hesina to Kaladin

Spren are fragments of the powers of creation that have gained sentience through the influence of sapient beings on Roshar. They are vastly varied in their appearances, characteristics, and levels of intelligence. They are deeply connected with the Knights Radiant, as a Nahel Bond between humans and spren is what allows the former to use Surgebinding. They are also used to create fabrials.

Spren are far more extensive and numerous than the closest comparable entities, seons and skaze, Splinters of Devotion and Dominion respectively. This is one of the reasons Roshar does not have the same problem with travelling to the Cognitive Realm as Sel -- even though Honor is Splintered just like the other two Shards, on Roshar, spren act as a "release valve" for the uncontrolled power of Honor.</description>

      <description>Shu-Dereth is one of the major religions on Sel. Shu-Dereth is an offshoot of Shu-Keseg. It was founded by Dereth, a disciple of Keseg. However, Shu-Dereth differs from Shu-Keseg in the way that it focuses on the equality of obedience, rather than the equality of mind. Shu-Dereth is based on the worship of Jaddeth, a God who is said to slumber in the earth, waiting for a time when the whole world worships him to return and rule the world. Followers of Shu-Dereth are known as Derethi, and the religion's holy book is called the Do-Dereth.

Dereth’s ideas were originally rejected in his native JinDo; however, they were embraced by the Fjordell. Shu-Dereth has been the official religion of Fjorden since the conversion of Wulfden the First and has spread to all of the eastern nations. Since that time, the leader of Shu-Dereth takes receives the title Wyrn upon his ascension. Wyrn acts both as Jaddeth's prophet and regent during his entrapment on earth.

Fjorden’s society stratified and organized Shu-Dereth’s teachings to a martial level. As a result, Shu-Dereth is a highly militaristic religion, and is based on a regimented ranking, known as the "Great Chain."</description>

The book is set in the world of Elantris occurring at the same time as certain events in the book but centers on different characters. Brandon Sanderson commented, "If you haven't read the novel Elantris, this contains major spoilers. Might I suggest reading the book first?

      <description>Shu-Keseg was a religion practised on Sel.

It was the precursor to the Shu-Korath and Shu-Dereth religions. It was founded by a JinDo man named Keseg who preached unity of all mankind. His two disciples Korath and Dereth collected his teachings in a book called the Do-Kando. After Keseg died Korath and Dereth disagreed about how to achieve this unity. Korath thought that mankind should be united through love, whereas Derethi believed mankind should united through obediance by the rule of a single "Holy" government. This disagreement caused the schism in Shu-Keseg.</description>

Though there is some grey area in what it means to be a Sliver, individuals who have directly held the power of a Shard are usually termed Slivers.</description>

      <description>"The Spiritual Realm contains an object's soul—its essence—as well as the ways it is connected to the things and people around it."

- Shai's description of the Spiritual Realm

The Spiritual Realm is the realm of existence in the cosmere that contains the essence or soul of things. In this Realm, the interconnection between objects, people, and ideals are made apparent.

Everything in the cosmere has a Spiritual aspect, a soul, which represents the idealized form or concept upon which their existence is based. Among sentient creatures, this soul is sometimes described as a Spiritweb. Several manifestations of Investiture such as gold Feruchemy and Regrowth can restore a damaged object or person into the ideal form as dictated by the soul.</description>

The book follows Waxillium Ladrian, a descendant of Breeze and former lawman who returns from the Roughs to assume leadership of his house in the wake of his uncle's passing, and Wayne - Wax's formidable partner and old friend. The two of them are Twinborn, with both one Allomantic power and one Feruchemical power.</description>

      <description>The siege of Luthadel was a major event following the end of the Final Empire on Scadrial.

The armies of Straff Venture, Ashweather Cett, and the Koloss army of Jastes Lekal besieged Luthadel, King Elend Venture's throne. Originally, Straff Venture's numerically superior force was poised to take control of the city, leading to some diplomatic overtures between Cett and Elend in response. However, this balance was upset by the entry of the Koloss army, with the potential to defeat any of the human armies present. Elend was deposed and the city raised Ferson Penrod to be king. Vin intimidated the opposition through the use of duralumin-enhanced emotional Allomancy upon Venture and an assault upon Cett's force within Luthadel's walls. However, Vin's apparent need to seek the Well of Ascension and save Scadrial from the Deepness led her to leave the city, accompanied by Elend and Spook, on a journey to Terris before the battle for the city began.

The Battle of Luthadel was triggered by the lack of control that Lekal held over his Koloss force, who attacked the city of their own accord. The Koloss force successfully breached the city walls, which, punctuated by so many gates, were difficult for the defenders to hold. During this assault, Dockson, Clubs and Tindwyl were all killed by the Koloss.

Upon realising that the well was in Luthadel and that she, Elend and Spook were sent away for their own safety, Vin returned to the city and took control of the Koloss using emotional Allomancy. Her swift execution of Straff Venture and her control over the Koloss army allowed Elend to retake control of Luthadel and be crowned Emperor of the New Empire.</description>

      <description>"I am a god. [...] A little piece of one. Very, very little."

- Syl to Kaladin

A Splinter is the term for a specific type of fragment of Investiture that is ultimately derived from Adonalsium. These Splinters can be composed of a single Shard's power or the Investiture of multiple Shards. They are present in many worlds of the cosmere, sometimes in abundant quantities or with self-aware personalities, while other times they are absent altogether or exist simply as a chunk of raw power guided by something else. These Splinters often possess abilities themselves or are capable of granting abilities by bonding with people. Splinters are generally ageless and difficult to kill or destroy. The spren of Roshar and the seons of Sel are some of the most well-known, although many species of Splinters can be found throughout the cosmere. The Shards Honor, Ambition, Devotion, and Dominion have been Splintered, and therefore large portions of their power exist as Splinters.</description>

      <description>The Liar of Partinel is an unpublished cosmere work that Brandon Sanderson wrote in 2007.

The story takes place on the world of Yolen and features a character called Midius, a Lightweaver who adopts the name of his master, Hoid. When it was written, this book was intended to serve as a prequel to the story arc of a rewritten Dragonsteel Prime, but would have been published as a standalone book to avoid confusion with the main Dragonsteel sequence.

It was Sanderson's first attempt at writing Hoid's origin story, which he wanted to be "epic and awesome," but it just wasn't working and "every chapter was a chore to write." He does not distribute this book because the personality of one character "never clicked," and he does not want it to color fans' predispositions towards that character. He still intends to write this story some day, probably after the Stormlight Archive is finished, though he will rewrite it from scratch. The Ars Arcanum of Words of Radiance claims that Roshar's Lightweaving is the most similar to the "original Yolish variant," suggesting that this portion of the magic will stay canon.</description>

Tevidian bedded many skaa women. Ultimately, he illegitimately sired Vin and her younger sister, providing them both Allomancy, Vin being Mistborn and her younger sister being a Seeker. He claimed he killed every skaa he slept with, but Vin's mother deceived Tevidian into thinking she was noble, and so he was lax with her. Tevidian eventually found her and killed her, but did not manage to kill Vin or her sister. Tevidian did not recognize Vin, and Vin suspected Tevidian never knew he was a father.</description>

      <description>The Siege of Fadrex City was one of the major events on Scadrial between the Collapse of the Final Empire and the ascension of Sazed.

The human and koloss armies of the New Empire under Emperor Elend Venture's command, besieged Fadrex City, the seat of Aradan Yomen's throne. Elend lead an army of thirty six thousand soldiers against twenty five thousand defenders. These armies have been assessed as nearly of the same strength, taking account of the strong defense fortification of Fadrex City. Elend also commanded twenty thousand koloss, which unbalanced the strength of the two armies.

After two weeks Yomen started the first attack on the army of the New Empire. It consisted of three small attacks, one coming from north and the second from south. Both were used as a distraction from the third one, taking place at the koloss camp. Eleven thousand koloss died under the fire of catapults or killing each other in bloodlust.

After this incident Elend asked to debate with Yomen. The conference resulted in Venture's wife Vin being taken hostage. Elend reacted by fighting a koloss army nearby Fadrex City and returning with twenty eight thousand koloss, which made his koloss army thirty seven thousand koloss strong.

Following the orders of Marsh, Yomen sent his army to the fields to battle the koloss army. Although Elend easily could have beaten the army, he drew back, heeding the advice of his general, Hammond. This proved to be a good idea, since Ruin eventually took control over all the koloss in order to annihilate both the armies of Elend and Yomen.

As the koloss broke mad, Yomen decided to open his gates to let the army of Elend in. Meanwhile, Vin escaped from Fadrex City and travelled to Luthadel.

Ruin gathered a large koloss army in front of the city. In Fadrex City Elend began to understand the function of the mistfallen and realized that he now had a new army of five thousand Mistings. After this conclusion, Ruin ordered the attack on Fadrex.

After some hours of fighting the koloss suddenly ran away from the city, in the direction of Luthadel, where Vin took up the Shard Preservation.</description>

      <description>A spanreed is a type of conjoiner fabrial developed sometime before the War of Reckoning that enabled long distance communication on the world of Roshar.

Spanreeds, like all conjoiner fabrials, are made by capturing a spren inside a ruby and splitting it in half. The two halves are then embedded in reed pens. The two pens can then mimic the movements of the other, exactly. The energy required for the second pen to move is provided by the holder of the first pen, which feels twice as heavy as an ordinary pen would.

The setting of the ruby can be rotated to switch between different "modes." One is to alert the possessor of the spanreed's twin that a conversation is desired. Another to alert the first that the message was received. The third and fourth notches sync the movements of the two pens, each notch makes one pen the transmitter and the other the receiver. Vorin men who do not write can communicate with a spanreed by turning the gem on and off to indicate that they are still alive.

By the sixth year of the War of Reckoning spanreeds have achieved widespread use, at least among the Vorin nations, from the Shattered Plains, to Kharbranth, and even to the isolated estates of House Davar.

Tashikk is beginning to become a spanreed hub, with several people and places having reeds connected to various businesses in Tashikk. The Tashikk operator is hired by the remote user to exchange messages, to research on your behalf, and to make other enquiries.

Spanreeds cannot be used effectively whilst moving when its pair is stable. Since the function of fabrials is dependent on the user's frame of reference, a spanreed in motion would be incapable of relaying a clear message to its stationary pair. If both spanreeds are on the same ship, for example, then the spanreed would function properly because both users have the same frame of reference. This is also why spanreeds are unaffected by the planet's motion and curvature.</description>

- Mraize upon receiving information about Amaram and the Sons of Honors' plans

Thaidakar is a leader of the Ghostbloods on Roshar, sometimes referred to as Master Thaidakar by Ghostbloods. Thaidakar, along with the Ghostbloods, is often mentioned opposing the Sons of Honor.

As Gavilar Kholin--a prominent Son of Honor--lay dying, he told Szeth to "tell Thaidakar he was too late."

When Kaladin killed Helaran Davar in Meridas Amaram's army, Amaram--another Son of Honor--thought Thaidakar and the Ghostbloods were behind the attack, saying the Ghostbloods were growing more bold.

Prior to the Battle of Narak, Shallan Davar brought Mraize pages that transcribed text from Amaram's room discussing the Voidbringers and the Shattered Plains. Then, Shallan overheard Mraize saying that they should bring these pages to Master Thaidakar, and that Restares's cronies--the Sons of Honor--were also growing close to the answers of the Shattered Plains.</description>

      <description>"True Surges are of both Honor and Cultivation—Cultivation for life, Honor to make the Surge into natural law. Things must fall to the ground, so they created Surges to make it happen."

- Raboniel, lecturing Venli

Surgebinding is a prime manifestation of Investiture on Roshar. Surgebinders can manipulate ten fundamental forces locally known as Surges, with each Surgebinder having access to two of the Surges with overlap between them, by infusing objects or beings with Stormlight. Each Surgebinder's Surges come in a set combination, for example, it is possible to have the Surges of Progression and Illumination or Progression and Abrasion, but not Progression and Gravitation.</description>

      <description>Skai was the original Vessel of the Shard Dominion. Sometime after the Shattering, they and Aona took up residence on Sel. Edgli believes that, by doing so, they violated the original Vessels' pact to not settle on the same world as another Shard, though the exact terms of that agreement are somewhat unclear.

Sometime in the distant past, Odium arrived on Sel and attacked both Skai and Aona, killing both of them and Splintering their Shards. At the time, he was hunting Ambition, but found them first, and likely used their alleged violation of the Vessels' pact as justification for killing them. After Aona and Skai died, Odium locked much of Devotion and Dominion's power in the Cognitive Realm to prevent them from gaining another Vessel, which makes the Cognitive Realm around Sel very dangerous.

On present-day Sel, while most of Skai's power remains trapped in the Cognitive Realm, some of it still influences the Physical Realm. The skaze are Splinters of Dominion, and some vestiges of Skai's power appear to be allowing Wyrn Wulfden the Fourth to see the future.</description>

      <description>Spook’s note contains a message to Vin, warning her about Ruin’s ability to manipulate people whose body is pierced by metal. While holding the power of Preservation, Kelsier managed to speak to Spook after he was wounded in the Coup of Urteau and encouraged him to send the message, which Kelsier hoped would get Vin to remove her earring.

Spook inscribed it on a thin metal sheet, since only text carved in metal couldn’t be altered and read by Ruin. Because Spook was seriously injured during the Coup of Urteau, he was unable to deliver the note personally, but Captain Goradel offered to do so since Vin had saved his life on the night of the Collapse.

Goradel set out from Urteau in the direction of Luthadel, where Vin was heading. The note, however, never got to Vin, as Ruin sent Marsh to intercept him. Marsh killed Goradel after a short fight, then took the message, which Ruin forced him to read aloud so that he coud learn what it said.

Kelsier, however, had expected Ruin to do this, and actually intended for Marsh to receive the message. When Marsh captured Vin in Luthadel, Kelsier used Preservation's power to attack Ruin, distracting the Shard just enough for Marsh to reassert control over himself and pull out Vin's earring, which allowed her to finally Ascend as Preservation.</description>

      <description>Tekiel Tower is a large skyscraper built by House Tekiel in Elendel on Scadrial. It is located in the financial district of the 4th Octant, on the bank of the 4th 5th Canal, across from the Ironspine Building. Tekiel Tower is tall enough that even when uncompleted, its top was obscured by the mists on the rare nights they appeared.

Its construction is in a sort-of race with the Ironspine Building to be the tallest building in Elendel. The architects would come up with revised blueprints of taller and taller buildings, attempting to outdo one another. Credible rumors said that both the Tekiel Tower and the Ironspine Building would top over fifty stories tall. During the raids by the Vanishers, Tekiel tower is still uncompleted, and perhaps will remain so, due to the financial collapse of House Tekiel.</description>

Svorden is a small country on Sel. Its capital is Seraven.

Svorden is located on a peninsula at the northeastern-most tip of Sycla. The country borders Fjorden to the southwest, with Fjordell forts just across the border. to the south, Svorden is separated from Geant and the city Velf by a river. The rest of the country is bordered by the Sea of Fjorden. The capital, Seravan, is at the northeastern tip of the country. Svorden is sixteen million four hundred thousand seven hundred and seventy-two steps from Elantris.

It was overtaken by the Fjordell Empire. Svorden is politically the second most important nation in the east and are a close ally to Fjorden. Unlike other nations in the Fjordell Empire, Svorden has maintained a strong national identity. To the people of the east, Svorden is considered a province of Fjorden in all but name. Svorden had once sent gifts, including a table, to the Rose Empire, but the current relationship between the countries is strained. They are known for their navy, which is currently under Wulfden the Fourth's command.

Svorden is the center of culture and learning in the east. They have a well regarded university that Lukel and Jalla have studied at. Discoveries that have come out of Svorden is the idea that humans can only earn six languages and an eclipse occuring when the moon falls into the planet's shadow. Along with JinDo, they have managed to keep their own language and become wealthy. Shai, a citizen of the distant Rose Empire, is able to read Svordish literature, although she finds it quite difficult. Svorden has fine locksmiths employed by Wyrn. Many people in Svorden follow the Derethi religion. Svorden shark fights are a form of entertainment. There are Svordish epics about different heroes.

Jalla is the only currently known Svordish person. Notable visitors to Svorden include Lukel, Hrathen, and Sarene.</description>

      <description>Snapping is the process by which someone gains the powers of Allomancy on Scadrial.

Snapping commonly occurs when a Misting or Mistborn undergoes heavy stress and pain, often in a near-death situation, causing them to trigger latent Allomantic abilities. According to Realmatic Theory, this creates a crack on the soul which the power can fit into. There are some similarities on this to other magic systems, such as the Knights Radiant all being "broken" as indicated by Syl.

In the Final Empire, children of confirmed noble bloodlines often undergo a planned beating as a test to see if they Snap. Later, however, the mists cause sickness in people, triggering their own Snapping; this process is started by Preservation, but is manipulated by Ruin into killing people, thus raising superstitions about the mists being dangerous.

The length a person has "mist sickness" relates to their Allomantic powers and abilities. The most powerful atium mistings are sick for the longest time.

During the time the mists are Snapping people in The Hero of Ages, they also raise the Allomantic potential of the people they Snap so that exactly 16% are Snapped. The number is a hint left by Preservation for humans to understand.

At some point after the Final Ascension, Harmony is disturbed by the process of Snapping and alters the way it operates, but it is not clear how Snapping works now.</description>

      <description>Steen is a kingdom at the tip of a peninsula in southwestern Roshar. As such, it only borders Liafor.

During the Silver Kingdoms era, it was part of Makabakam. Noura describes them as a tricky bunch, and hints that they shouldn't be invited to the Urithiru talks along with the other Makabak representatives.

Beard tells a tale about him swimming across a vat of dyes when in service to the Steen merchant lords. The crew of First Dreams on its trip to Akinah is made up of Steen mercenaries.

Just before the Battle of Thaylen Field, a report from Steen relayed to a meeting in Urithiru confirms that the early Everstorm reported by Shinovar has passed and also mentions that it is faster and more violent than previous storms. This comes just before the other revelations about the Eila Stele and the first Voidbringers.

Prior to the voyage of the Wandersail to Aimia, Lopen indicates that men from Steen were present in Urithiru. Specifically, he noted that their beards were wrapped in cords - a fashion that has been shown elsewhere in Roshar and the cosmere.. Later, Nikli comments that 'ordinary people' in Aimia (i.e. not the Sleepless) wore their beards in the peculiar cord-like style of Steen.</description>

      <description>The Tarat Sea is a gulf of the Southern Depths on Roshar.

It is surrounded by the southern coasts of Alethkar, Jah Keved, Triax, Tu Fallia, Greater Hexi, the northern coast of Frostlands, and the city-state of Kharbranth and opens into Longbrow's Straits. There are a number of islands near the coasts of Triax, Tu Fallia and Greater Hexi. Many of the southern rivers in Alethkar and Jah Keved, including the Deathbend River, flow into the Tarat Sea.

The war-room prior to the Battle of Thaylen Field featured a map of the gulf, marking the locations of parts of the Azish and Kharbranth fleets. After the battle, Kaladin is sent to find Skar, Drehy and Gavinor Kholin and flies over the gulf from Kharbranth to meet them.</description>

      <description>The Southern Depths is the ocean to the south of Roshar. It lies off the coast of Tukar, Marat, and Thaylenah. It is presumably quite deep. It also likely extends to the south pole of the planet.

It was said if one controls Thaylenah and Thaylen City, one could control the entire Southern Depths. This strategic importance led to Voidbringer forces to Thaylen City near the beginning of the True Desolation. A Thaylen merchant ship tried to scout for Voidbringers in the Southern Depths near Marat and spotted a large number of ships at dock along the coast. The ship relayed the information via spanreed. Then, figures with glowing eyes--the Fused--rose from a nearby city, attacking the ship, and the ship was never seen from again. Shortly thereafter, the Voidbringer forces launched from Marat to Thaylen City, using the Everstorm to propel them quickly across the Southern Depths, triggering the Battle of Thaylen Fields.</description>

      <description>The Sunmaker Mountains are a mountain range in Alethkar. The range cuts across central Alethkar, adjacent to the princedoms of Kholin, Ruthar, Aladar, Thanadal and Hatham. They are named after the Sunmaker, an Alethi king that united the highprinces and helped to overthrow the Hierocracy.

In the Cognitive Realm, the reflection of the Sunmaker Mountains is a body of water called the Salavashi Trench.

It is possible that some of the peaks in the Sunmaker Mountains are above the top of the highstorms.

Koron accents come from a place near the Sunmaker Mountains, in central Alethkar.</description>

It may be a popular home for the descendants of the Terris people.

Steris Harms commented that if one wished to sell metals in Tathingdwel, one would need to pass through Elendel. She used this to drive home a point that some outside Elendel think that Elendel has too much power in the Basin. Her comment might imply that Tathingdwel has a large market for metals, perhaps due to its Terris population, which could require metals for use in Feruchemy.</description>

The Spiritweb is the network of Connections and Investiture which make up the soul of a creature, place, or object. Residing in the Spiritual Realm, Spiritwebs lack any tangible shape or size, with their borders defined by their Identity. Contained within a Spiritweb are various pieces, including Spiritual DNA, the Spiritual Aspect, and one’s Spiritual Ideal.</description>

      <description>The Survival Shard is one of the sixteen Shards of Adonalsium. Virtually nothing is known about this Shard, including its intent and where it currently resides.

The one hint to its existence is a cryptic quote that Brandon signed in a book. Responding to the question "Give us the name of a Shard's intent we have not seen before," he wrote, "there is one who just wants to hide and survive." This is likely referring to surviving Odium's onslaught against the other Shards.

Since then, the Shards Ambition, Invention, Mercy, Valor, and Whimsy have all been revealed; Ambition has already been Splintered by Odium, but any of the latter four could plausibly be this Shard. On the other hand, Brandon has implied that this Shard's intent may be similar to "Wisdom" or "Prudence".

The Shard's intent is only tangentially related to its desire to hide. The desire comes from its knowledge of events in the Cosmere. This desire not to be caught is "quite intelligent," though it has realized over time that this desire may not be the most important thing.</description>

      <description>A soulstamp is a tool used in Forgery. The most powerful kind of soulstamp is called an Essence Mark.

Soulstamps are used to stamp an object with a seal which changes the object's past in a way described by the design of the stamp. The seal left by the stamp itself is also called a soulstamp. If the new history is similar enough to the original the stamp will take. If not, the stamp will fail after an amount of time relative to the similarity of the histories. A plausible enough stamp will stay nearly permanently.

The seals left by soulstamps were slightly indented, and had a noticeable texture to them, regardless of the material they were stamped into. When a stamp fails, the embossed texture disappears, and the ink becomes as if fresh.</description>

      <description>The Takers were a squad of soldiers in Amaram's army lead by Tukks on Roshar that Kaladin was a member of.

The squad was composed of darkeyes, and fought using spears. Outside of battle, they also trained new soldiers, both with spear and with quarterstaff. Their training methods included corporal punishment.

It was Kaladin's first unit upon joining, and it was there that he refined his talent with the spear into proper skill. At some point, either most or all of them died, and Kaladin was transferred elsewhere, perhaps straight to leading his own squad.</description>

      <description>Taran is a serving boy in Tvlakv's slave caravan on Roshar.

He is described as lanky, and he tends to the chulls that pull the caravan. He is present when Tvlakv transports Kaladin and a number of other slaves to the Shattered Plains. Along with Bluth and Tag, he appears to be in Tvlakv's employ, as he is not kept in a cage like the slaves.

Taran's fate is unknown after the slave caravan reached the Sadeas warcamp. When Shallan Davar travels with Tvlakv's caravan after the attack on the Wind's Pleasure, Taran is not mentioned and Bluth has been tasked with caring for the chulls.</description>

      <description>The Steel alphabet was the set of glyphs used on Scadrial. It has been shown that the glyphs evolved over time.

Most of the symbols were also used to represent various metals and numbers. The steel alphabet used a base-16 numbering system similar to Japanese numerals, with double-number pairs given to represent the order of magnitude and the number in that position respectively.

At some point the alphabet diverged such that the symbols used to represent Feruchemical metals were distinct to those used by Allomancy and the general alphabet.

During the technological advancement after the Final Ascension, the symbols used during the Final Empire were tweaked to become easier for printing.

"The three sets of symbols show the progression of the Allomantic text through the ages. The earliest script is from Hero of Ages. It was changed and modified into the Terris script symbols we see in Well of Ascension. After more time, the Terris script morphed into what is now known as the Allomantic Alphabet or the Steel Alphabet, which are the symbols used in Mistborn: The Final Empire. We've extrapolated the Steel Alphabet into a script that's more-standardized and refined for the chapter headings in Alloy of Law, which takes place 300 years after Hero of Ages."

      <description>Teoras is the capital city of Teod on Sel. It is surrounded by forest and hosted a large sea-port.

Teoras was best known for housing the largest Korathi temple in Teod. However, when Sarene entered Elantris with Raoden (under the guise of Spirit), she gasped at the Korathi chapel there and its beauty, saying its wall reliefs were more intricate than even Teoras's temple, which implies that perhaps Teoras's temple was only matched by the Elantrian Korathi temples. So, during the time after the Reod and before the restoration of Elantris, Teoras's temple would have been the largest Korathi temple in the world.

"Spirit laughed again, leading her into a large, stately building. Sarene gasped in wonder at its beauty. It was lined with delicate, spiraled arches, and the floor was crafted of pale white marble. The wall reliefs were even more intricate than those on the Korathi temple in Teoras."

- Sarene on entering the Elantrian chapel.

When Sarene was eleven a troop of players passed through Teoras and Sarene declared she wished to be an actress rather than a princess.

Under Dilaf, the Dakhor attacked Teoras in the Battle of Teoras.</description>

      <description>Snarlbrush is a plant native to Roshar. It is known to grow in northwestern Alethkar, near Hearthstone.

It is a robust plant that grows in dense thickets around large markel trees; the trees and the tight grouping of the plants help to provide some protection from highstorms.

Snarlbrush is typically tan or brown colored, to the point that the plants appear to be dead. When they get wet, they instantly turn verdant green at the point of contact, then slowly fade back to brown as the water is absorbed deep into their branches. Kaladin recalls Lirin telling him about this unusual property.</description>

      <description>Sonn is the Varvax Foreign Minister. In 2211, he communicates with Jason Write via holovid, suggesting that he is on Earth.

In 2211, after the body of a Varvax ambassador is found on Evensong, Jason contacts him to apologize on behalf of humankind. Sonn, however, instead apologizes to Jason for the trouble and states that the ambassador knew the risks of living with a "underdeveloped civilization." Since humans have yet to reach Primary Intelligence, Sonn and the Varvax do not hold any "acts of barbarity" against them. At some point prior to 2211, he had admitted to Jason that it is possible to suppress Cytonic abilities; that knowledge allowed Jason to escape when he was captured by Edmund. After Jason defeats Edmund, he contacts Sonn, who admits that species of Primary Intelligence are only free of conflict because they lock away any discontents and use Cytonic suppression on them and apologizes to Jason for any inconvenience this revelation causes. He is greatly disturbed when Jason then reveals that some Varvax discontents have escaped and are trying to gain technologically-superior human weapons to wage war against the rest of the Varvax.

He is intrigued by the disparities within humankind, as some people are of Primary Intelligence, while some are as low as Fourth Intelligence, and is hopeful that they will soon let go of their attachment to technology so that they can advance themselves to Primary Intelligence.</description>

      <description>Taraco was a bandit in the Roughs, considered to be one of the greatest bandits of the age.

Waxillium Ladrian captured Taraco because he had robbed a cobbler a few days earlier, and Wax hoped to get a new pair of boots out of it. It was commonly thought that Wax went after Taraco because Taraco had shot a lawkeeper in Faradana the week before. In truth, Wax did not hear of the lawkeeper's death until he had brought Taraco in to face justice.

Wax tells the truth behind his capture of Taraco to convince Marasi Colms that his heroics look different from his perspective.</description>

      <description>Sliverism is a religion on Scadrial that arose after the Final Ascension.

According to Steris Harms, they are known to revere Ironeyes.

It can be inferred that Sliverism is an evolution of the dominant religion of the Final Empire, brought to the new world by obligators that survived the Final Ascension, as the Lord Ruler was referred to the "Sliver of Infinity" in religious terms. This is a possible motive for worshiping Ironeyes, as the old religion revered Steel Inquisitors, of which Ironeyes is the last member.</description>

      <description>"The Teo men prefer more physical contests, such as jousting or broadsword sparring. For a woman, however, the syre is perfect. The light blade allows us to make full use of our dexterity and allows us to capitalize on our superior intelligence."

- Sarene on the use of syres

The syre is a light sword created in Jaador on Sel. In Jaador, it was originally known as a jedaver, but is now more commonly known by its Fjordell name, syre.

In Jaador, the syre was originally a weapon for scouts, but fell into disuse before being reintroduced as a fencing weapon for the nobility. From there, the use of syres spread to Duladel, where they are sometimes known as kmeer. Duladel, however, was generally neutral, and the republican class turned fencing with the syre into a sport rather than using it for potentially lethal duels. Modern day Dulas consider the ability to fence with a syre a requirement for being viewed as a solider, regardless of how many battles a person has won. From Duladel, syres skipped over Arelon, as the Elantrians disapproved of anything resembling violence, but made their way to Teod, where fencing with them became a sport for women instead of men.

When Sarene moved to Arelon, she brought several of her syres with her, and eventually began teaching the noblewomen to fence, thus introducing the sport to Arelon.

Raoden, posing as a Dula named Kaloo, said that though Dulas can duel well, a syre isn't much good against a trained soldier.</description>

      <description>Silence's waystop was a waystop run by Silence Montane in the Forests of Hell.

Silence and her daughter, William Ann, ran the waystop, along with a young girl named Sebruki. They had Dob as a stablehand.

Silence's waystop was mostly a simple inn, with a common room where food and drink was served, and a kitchen which had been scrubbed so thoroughly by Sebruki that the wood had been bleached. They served venison with gravy and beer, and kept pigs.

Silence's waystop was considered to be neutral territory in the Forests, due in part to the belief that it was guarded by the shade of her husband. The costs of running the waystop were high and it was a difficult life, but the bounty on Chesterton Divide and his men was enough money to supply the waystop for a year or two.

Silence has laid out 3 concentric rings of silver around her waystop (a common practice for waystops) in order to keep the shades out. Apparently, there is some agreement between the patrons and the owner of the waystop, where the rings are intended to keep shades out, and not to trap them inside.

There are fewer and fewer travelers going past Silence's waystop, due to the fact that the number of shades has increased.</description>

Springrails are the primary form of transportation between islands. On many islands, the springrail station is an important location. Springrails have gotten cheaper over time. Many Rithmatists are employed by springrail companies, using chalklings with Glyphs of Rending to wind large spools to power the springrails. Joel's father allegedly died in a springrail accident.</description>

Talatin was a Knight Radiant and member of the Order of Stonewards on Roshar. It is not known when exactly they lived, but it was prior to the Day of Recreance and the dissolution of most of the Radiant Orders.

Jasnah Kholin finds a quote that is attributed to Talatin during her research of ancient Rosharan texts and adds it to her notebook. The quote mentions fighting Voidbringers and warns against their ability to transform.</description>

      <description>Terxim was an author in ancient Roshar. He lived prior to the Recreance.

He wrote an autobiography that was lost in a fire at the original Palanaeum, with the exception of a single page. On the page there was a line that interested Jasnah Kholin during her research, as it referenced Urithiru. Terxim expressed some frustration about the Knights Radiant and their control of travel through the Oathgate hub in the tower city. "Though I was due for dinner in Veden City that night, I insisted upon visiting Kholinar to speak with Tivbet. The tariffs through Urithiru were growing quite unreasonable. By then, the so-called Radiants had already begun to show their true nature."

      <description>A sparkflicker (sometimes spark-flicker) is a Herdazian fire striker that can also be worn as an ornament.

It is similar in use to flint-and-steel, albeit it lacks the flint. Rather, a Herdazian wearing a sparkflicker uses their own nails (which are crystalline, owning to their singer ancestry) to start the fire. In addition, it is sometimes used as an ornament or a decorative article of clothing. It has no martial application.

In the Shattered Plains warcamps, a Herdazian is seen using a sparkflicker and oil to make bursts of flames in the air. Some Alethi believe that all Herdazians wear sparkflickers, though Havarah, an Alethi with Herdazian ancestry and fingernails, doesn't carry one.</description>

Taff is in a hallway with three other servants when they are attacked by Vasher as he infiltrates the palace. Taff is immediately tied up with an Awakened rope. Rariv and another servant run for help; Lolan becomes distracted by Nightblood and is knocked unconscious by Vasher. When help arrives, the rope binding Taff is no longer Awakened, but he has been stabbed and killed. After interviewing the witnesses, Lightsong deduces that the initial assailant (Vasher) was not the murderer. The killer was Denth, who was tailing Vasher. Taff was presumably killed because he was the only person who would have been able to identify Denth.</description>

      <description>Thame is an Idrian living in the slums of T'Telir on Nalthis.

He works for Rira, mostly bringing desperate or inexperienced Idrians into Rira's operations, and when he overheard Rira selling information of Vivenna's whereabouts, he decided to go see the Idrian princess for himself. He is interrogated by Denth and Tonk Fah, and then begins operating as a liaison between Vivenna and the Idrian element in T'Telir, arranging meetings for her with some of the Idrian commoners and several of the crime lords.

He maintains a loyalty to the Idrian government and a belief in Austrism, though his day to day actions reflect little of these.</description>

      <description>"Though many wished Urithiru to be built in Alethela, it was obvious that it could not be. And so it was that we asked for it to be placed westward, in the place nearest to Honor."

- Perhaps the oldest surviving original source mentioning the city, requoted in The Vavibrar, line 1804. What I wouldn't give for a way to translate the Dawnchant.

The Vavibrar is a work of literature on Roshar.

Jasnah Kholin includes a selection from The Vavibrar (requoted from an older work) in her notebook while researching Urithiru. The quote mentions that some of the founders of Urithiru originally expressed a desire to place it in the Silver Kingdom of Alethela, but this was deemed impractical for unknown reasons. The city was instead placed "near Honor", in the mountains of the Kingdom of Makabakam.

Jasnah also notes her desire to be able to translate the dead language known as Dawnchant, which would later be cracked by Navani Kholin through Dalinar's visions.</description>

Dalinar tells Adolin that Talata needs to review Highprince Bethab's chull contracts with Elhokar. Bethab had previously tried to slip language into a contract that would give him favor in a succession. Talata is presumably the best scribe in the Kholin warcamp for this task, as Dalinar asks for her by name.</description>

      <description>"I am a stick"

- Stick

Stick is an ordinary stick.

Shallan tried to Soulcast Stick after escaping the Wind's Pleasure, but was unable to convince it to change. During the Battle of Thaylen Field, Shallan thinks back to her encounter with Stick.

After Words of Radiance came out, members of the 17th Shard fansite latched on to Stick and turned it into an in-joke. On April Fools Day in 2014, Brandon released a "deleted interlude" from Stick's perspective, which can be read here.</description>

      <description>The Song of Listing is one of the songs detailing the oral history of the listeners on Roshar. It recounts many of the common forms that listeners were once able to take. It it not known to mention any of the "forms of power" granted by bonding a Voidspren, which are covered by other songs such as the Song of Secrets. The song has at least 91 stanzas, and Eshonai notes that the old songs recount "hundreds" of forms.

The Song of Listing was presumably written by the Last Legion to ensure that they remembered these forms, as they were only able to use dullform and mateform after they abandoned their gods.

By the time of the War of Reckoning, the Listeners had rediscovered nimbleform, warform, and workform after generations of research. Scholars continued to research the secrets to unlocking other forms known from the song such as artform and mediationform. With the advent of the True Desolation, the listeners regained access to forms that had been abandoned. The singers who had previously been enslaved as the parsh were given at least a dozen options of forms after they were freed, and are seen using various forms including artform and scholarform.</description>

He joins Shallan during her journey towards the Shattered Plains warcamps. He presumably reaches them with her, as slaves are mentioned carrying her trunk into the Kholin camp. If so, he would later become a member of Sebarial's manor staff.</description>

      <description>The Sixth Incarnation of Pandora is a far-future sci-fi novel. It is the fifth novel Brandon Sanderson wrote. It is unlikely that it will ever be published.

It features a man who used nanotechnology to make himself immortal, but was also driven insane by the process and the consequences thereof. Brandon has described it as the "most un-Brandon-like" book he has ever written as well as it being dark, grisly, and violent.</description>

      <description>Skip is a child employed as dragon bait by a group of hunters.

Skip lives on Sixthface on the cube, where people are born with simple magic talents known as knacks. Skip has three knacks, the first and most unfortunate of which is smelling delicious to dragons. His second knack is the ability to hear spelling and punctuation. His third knack is unknown.

As a result of his knack of hearing spelling and punctuation, he is very interested in words and a stickler for grammar and spelling. He would like to become a lexicographer and collect all the words and their spellings into a dictionary.

Skip's ability to smell delicious to dragons got him run out of towns a number of times, before he joined up with Johnston's Spears, Dragon Hunters as dragon bait. The group was later hired by a sorceress from Dawnface who took them into the highlands, looking to hunt and kill a specific dragon. After failing to find the dragon she was looking for, she told the hunters that they would be venturing further into the mountains, where larger and more powerful dragons are common. This led Skip to abandon the group, as he feared finally being eaten by a dragon. However, after leaving the hunters, he was cornered, alone, by a dragon on his way home. His fate is unknown.</description>

- Kaladin's thoughts while looking at the sky

The Tear is a particularly bright star seen from Roshar. It is named for the single tear shed by Reya. In early Ishi, it can be seen around sunset from the Shattered Plains, where it appears just above the horizon. It may also be visible from Scadrial.</description>

      <description>"Taking the Dawnshard, known to bind any creature voidish or mortal, he crawled up the steps crafted for Heralds, ten strides tall apiece, toward the grand temple above."

- A quote from The Poem of Ista, as transcribed by Jasnah Kholin

The Poem of Ista is ancient poetry from Roshar.

It is notable for its mention of a Dawnshard, including a description of its ability to "bind" any creature. It also indicates that the Dawnshard was in the possession of an unknown male entity. It references a temple surrounded by very tall steps built for Heralds.

Jasnah Kholin includes an excerpt from the poem in one of her notebooks while researching Voidbringers and Urithiru. Jasnah finds it curious that Dawnshards are mentioned often in early mythologies, but are largely ignored by modern scholars.</description>

      <description>The Poem of the Seventh Morning is ancient poetry from Roshar.

The poem itself has been lost, but parts of it survive through citations in other ancient works. During her research of Voidbringers, Jasnah Kholin quoted a snippet from the poem in her notebook. The quote contains some information attributed to an ancient Knight Radiant who was familiar with fighting Voidbringers.

"They changed, even as we fought them. Like shadows they were, that can transform as the flame dances. Never underestimate them because of what you first see."

- Purports to be a scrap collected from Talatin, a Radiant of the Order of Stonewards. The source - Guvlow's Incarnate - is generally held as reliable, though this is from a copied fragment of The Poem of the Seventh Morning, which has been lost.</description>

Soundsticks are wooden sticks that, when banged together, produce a loud noise. They are used to overload the senses of a Tineye or Mistborn burning tin.

A Smoker uses soundsticks to overload Vin's tin-enhanced hearing during her fight with Ashweather Cett's assassins. After the Watcher kills the Smoker, Vin uses the soundsticks to fight off a group of Thugs.</description>

Brandon's premise for the story was "How to Train Your Dragon but instead it's a girl who finds a spaceship and goes to Top Gun school. It's like a mashup between Top Gun and Ender's Game and How to Train Your Dragon with an old broken-down spaceship with a really weird personality."

The book was released on November 6, 2018.</description>

      <description>Songs of the Dead is the name of a planned novel by Brandon Sanderson and Peter Orullian about a heavy metal singer with necromantic powers. Brandon originated the story as an urban fantasy about a necromancer pizza delivery man and referred to it as Death by Pizza. The pizza delivery angle was later removed, with the protagonist changed to a heavy metal singer; Peter Orullian was brought on as co-author. Brandon then jokingly referred to the revamped story as Death Without Pizza before Orullian suggested the current name.</description>

She cares for and raises Susebron, reading stories from a book of children's tales, which he later inherits when she is taken away by the priests, as well as teaching him various things, such as the static nature of Returned bodies.

Due to the nature of the God Kings' line of succession, it is possible that she is not Susebron's biological mother, but was simply made queen when an infant returned. However, she is later confirmed to be the real mother of Susebron, and was formerly a poor merchant’s wife from far northern Hallandren. She died at some point during Susebron's life, and he remarks that the way she died is suspicious.</description>

      <description>The Lightweaver of Rens is an unpublished cosmere work set on Yolen. During Brandon's 2007 rewrite of the Dragonsteel series, he outlined this book as a direct sequel to The Liar of Partinel and a prequel to the main Dragonsteel arc. Brandon was ultimately dissatisfied with Liar, and so this book was never finished.

Similar to The Liar of Partinel, this story is believed to have featured a character named Midius who later becomes Hoid.</description>

      <description>The Siege of Mokia was a long lasting engagement between the Free Kingdoms and the Librarians.

The Librarians had besieged Mokia for many years until Alcatraz, Bastille, Kaz, and Aydee Ecks Smedry arrived. Talakimallo had supposedly been sent somewhere safe, but rather than leave his people, he sent his daughter to use Disguiser's Lenses to impersonate him and escape. The Shielder's Glass surrounding the city was nearly shattered, and Talakimallo was about to surrender, but Alcatraz successfully convinced him to keep fighting. They used Communicator's Glass to convince the Nalhallans to send support, and Leavenworth Smedry was sent with a fleet. But then, the Librarians emerged from a tunnel and attacked the city, putting Talakimallo in a coma. Since the king was no longer available, Alcatraz was the highest ranking person present, and was named leading monarch. Through a clever manipulation of Leavenworth's Talent, he was able to speed up the reinforcements, but it wasn't enough. The Shielder's Glass was broken, and Bastille was injured. His emotions building up inside him allowed him to use the breaking Talent to break the Librarian weapons, causing the Librarians to give up and leave. However, at the end no one in the Smedry clan could activate their Talent, including Alcatraz.</description>

Staccatos are likely part of the rockbud family. They are described as "polyplike", with retractable tendrils that emerge between highstorms.

The source of their name is not known, but may refer to a sound heard when the plants snap shut in anticipation of a storm.</description>

Whiskey from Stagin's still was a favorite of Waxillium Ladrian when he was a lawman in the Roughs. Wax used it in his vials of Allomantic steel shavings in lieu of water or some other liquid. When Wax returned to Elendel to take his place as leader of House Ladrian after his uncle's "death", he bemoaned the fact that his supply of Stagin's whiskey would soon run out.</description>

There are a number of nations on Sixthface, including Kalvonia and Tarseldia. One language spoken on Sixthface is Lukarvian.

The cube is saturated with magic, and as a result the people of the cube are born with innate magic, the manifestation of which depends on the Face where they were born. Sixthfacers are born with knacks, which are usually small, simple talents.</description>

The Village is in an area of the city where the fertile soil of the Elendel Basin is allowed to thrive untamed, giving the Village a forest-like appearance.

There is an agreement between the Synod and the Elendel government that grants a degree of autonomy to the Terris residents of the Village, allowing the Terris to police themselves without the interference of the local constabulary.</description>

      <description>A Soothing parlor is a type of business in Elendel where people go to to have their emotions dampened. For an additional fee, private sessions can be set up which may also include massage therapy.

Soothing parlors are required to have aluminum plating in the walls to prevent the effects of the Soothing inside the building from affecting people outside the building. This rule is not always enforced. The proprietors also wear aluminum lined hats so they can be immune to the Soothing around them.

Soothing parlors have been popular refuges during the time of high unemployment and social unrest leading up to the ousting of the corrupt Governor Innate.</description>

      <description>Soonie pups are a stuffed toy found in Elendel.

They have real fur and legs that can move. In The House Record, they are advertised as selling for 75 clips each, or one-Boxing-fifty for two.

Sazed included TenSoon in the Words of Founding, which means he is a well known part of the legends around the Catacendre. These toys are meant as representations of TenSoon in his wolfhound form. TenSoon himself is rather annoyed by his commercialisation.

Wax refers to the toys as "Soonie cubs".</description>

      <description>The List is a list of reasons why short people are better off than tall people according to Kazan Smedry. It is not clear if Kaz is serious about The List, but he takes every opportunity to recite from it. Australia Smedry finds The List ridiculous, as does Bastille. Kazan says that the facts on The List are scientifically researched and time-tested.</description>

      <description>Templeton Fig is a resident of New Seran on Scadrial who works for the Set. He appears to be at least somewhat wealthy.

Fig is the manager of the Seran New District Cemetery.

Fig uses the curse "Trell's soul!", which may indicate that he is a Trell worshiper.

He has a collection of stuffed albino animals, which he keeps fastidiously neat and arranged. He has been collecting them for some time, enough that he can tell when a specimen has been bleached and is not a true albino.</description>

      <description>"The land was soft and warm, and now it is harsh and broken and frozen."

- Allik Neverfar describing the events that nearly destroyed his people

The Southern Scadrians are a culture on Scadrial. They were placed at the south pole by The Lord Ruler during his Ascension. When he moved the planet closer to the sun, he altered the physiology of the skaa to enable them to survive the ash and the warmer temperatures. However, he also placed an unaltered group of Scadrians at the south pole to act as a control group for his genetic experiments. The Southern Scadrians lived there without any interaction with the Final Empire for over a thousand years until the Catacendre. When Harmony moved the planet back to its original orbit and orientation, it caused a change in climate that the Southern Scadrians failed to adapt to. The Southern Scadrians were at the brink of extinction until they were rescued by the Sovereign.</description>

      <description>Senior Mastrell Tendel is a sand master on the Dayside of Taldain. He is apparently in charge of coordinating the entrance exams for prospective sand masters looking to join the Diem.

Tendel, along with Lord Mastrell Praxton, is present for the entrance exam of Kenton, Traiben, and Drile. He is impressed by Drile's power, remarking that it has been years since he has seen a child so powerful. Upon finding out that Drile is Reenst Rile's son, he remarks that Drile is a "profitable catch in more way than one." When Kenton is barely able to manifest sand powers, he sympathetically apologizes to Praxton, who brushes off the comment. He, along with most of the Diem was killed by Kerztian warrior-priests when they attacked a weakened Diem.</description>

She was captured by Prof and led around town in a forcefield bubble while Prof was looking for Epics to turn or kill. This was to show his dominance over the town. However, she was soon released, as Prof realized her importance to Ildithia. Stormwind is killed by Prof accidentally after his battle with Tavi. The Reckoners are unable to get a sample of her skin cells, so her powers are lost.</description>

      <description>Snapshot is a non-cosmere science fiction novella by Brandon Sanderson.

"If you could re-create a day, what dark secrets would you uncover?

From New York Times number-one best-selling author Brandon Sanderson comes a detective thriller in a police beat like no other.

Anthony Davis and his partner, Chaz, are the only real people in a city of 20 million, sent there by court order to find out what happened in the real world 10 days ago so that hidden evidence can be brought to light and located in the real city today.

Within the re-created Snapshot of May 1, Davis and Chaz are the ultimate authorities. Flashing their badges will get them past any obstruction and overrule any civil right of the dupes around them. But the crimes the detectives are sent to investigate seem like drudgery - until they stumble upon the grisly results of a mass killing that the precinct headquarters orders them not to investigate. That's one order they have to refuse.

The hunt is on. And though the dupes in the replica city have no future once the Snapshot is turned off, that doesn't mean that both Davis and Chaz will walk out of it alive tonight."

      <description>The Taldain system is the planetary system that contains Taldain, where White Sand takes place. It is a binary system consisting of one large star and a secondary smaller star. The smaller, a relatively dim white dwarf, is surrounded by a dense cloud of particles known as the Particulate Ring. The larger, a blue-white supergiant, plays an important role in the means by which Taldain is Invested by Autonomy. The positioning of the system was intentionally designed by someone, presumably Autonomy.</description>

      <description>The Sleepless, also known as Dysian Aimians, are a sapient non-human race from an unknown planet in the cosmere. Their bodies are made up of swarms of creatures called "hordelings" that are mentally linked. They refer to themselves as "Sleepless" because at least some part of the horde is always awake. Some of the Sleepless can be found on Roshar, and they once lived in the Silver Kingdom of Aimia.</description>

      <description>A Snapshot is an exact re-creation of a specific day in the past but must be made within a few weeks of the day being recreated. Everything down to a molecule is the same as the day being re-created. Snapshots are made up of raw matter and energy in the system and anything left in the system will be recycled into the system for use in the next Snapshots.

Snapshots are made overnight with some computer code wired to some creature that is unconscious and dreams the Snapshot. Then at the end of the day, it can be ended with the press of a button.

The fake people inside a simulation are referred to as dupes. These dupes aren't aware they are in a Snapshot unless they see a Reality badge. If the dupes exit the boundary of the Snapshot they instantly disappear and if they are scheduled to enter the city they will immediately appear.

Real people can enter a snapshot to investigate but since they weren't there on the original day they cause Deviations. Entering and exiting a Snapshot can cause huge Deviations so detectives enter at the beginning of the day when the Snapshot is being created and exit only when they've completed all of their cases. When exiting a Snapshot dupes won't be able to see the door that real people use. Since everything is an exact recreation, real people can be killed in a Snapshot.

It is possible to create a Snapshot of a Snapshot.</description>

      <description>"The betrayal of spren has brought us here. They gave their Surges to human heirs, But not to those who know them most dear, before us. ’Tis no surprise we turned away Unto the gods we spent our days And to become their molding clay, they changed us."

- Song of Secrets, 40th Stanza

The singers are a sapient species on Roshar, which humans call the parsh or parshmen. One such group of singers are the listeners.

Singers communicate through special rhythms--hence them being called singers. Singers can bond various spren which change their forms.

Singers predate the humans as inhabitants of Roshar. Around the time of the Recreance, many of the singers had their Connection and Identity stolen, pieces of their souls ripped away. This made those singers docile and subservient, which humans called parshmen and used as slaves for millennia later. With the advent of the Everstorm, these singers were healed and restored.</description>

The Reserve acts as a protector of wealth so that gemstones do not need to be moved from one location to the next thus exposing them to the risk of theft. Many of the gems never leave the vault and are left uncharged.</description>

The Thaylen Sea is north of the Nexus of Imagination. It is very close to the Glasswater Deep and Luminous Shallows of the Sea of Lost Lights, although no direct waterways are visible in the available maps. Nazh marked the location of Thaylen City on the edge of the sea; northwest of the city there is a lake which Nazh hates. The lake corresponds to an island in Longbrow's Straits in the Physical Realm.</description>

      <description>South Hallen Channel is a location in the Sea of Lost Lights. It leads to the Emberdark Channel, where one can either go to Emberdark and beyond to the Burning Gardens, or go north to Celebrant.

It is unclear what exactly "Hallen" is, but there is also a North Hallen Channel directly north of the South Hallen Channel. Hallen might refer to the body of water between the rivers that the two channels lie along.

In the Physical Realm, the South Hallen Channel appears to lie along a tributary of the Deathbend River.</description>

      <description>The Simulacrum of Paralet is a statue in Thaylen City close to the temple of Battah.

It represents an unknown human figure, large enough to require several people to carry its parts and a set of ropes to pull them up.

During Dalinar's introductory tour of the city, he notices it has fallen over and off a ledge into the Loft Wards, presumably during one of the Everstorms, leaving behind only feet. When his group reaches them, Queen Fen mentions that it's one of the local highlights before noticing the damage. After Dalinar fixes the temple of Talenelat with his Bondsmith powers, he leads Fen's son Kdralk and a team of ten men back to the Simulacrum to heal the parts of it back into a whole.</description>

      <description>Shob is one of Shallan's men. He is constantly saying that he has come down with something, saying to Shallan that he is dying, and then later tells Veil that he is coming down with something. He seems to exaggerate this, as he shows a so-called rash on his arm, when the arm is perfectly normal.

He speaks in what appears to be a Bav accent, though some sentences come out in a neutral Alethi voice.

At some point in his life, Shob was in Sadeas' army on the Shattered Plains, but eventually decided to desert the army. After deserting, he joined a band of other deserters lead by Vathah that roamed the Frostlands stealing food from travelers and trying to stay alive and forget their pasts. In late 1173, the group intended to attack Tvlakv and Macob's caravans, but Shallan Davar intervened and convinced them to instead defend the caravans against another group of bandits.</description>

      <description>Sinaku'a is an Unkalaki on Roshar related to Kef'ha and Lunamor.

Based on Unkalaki cultural traditions, Sinaku'a was presumably related to his nuatoma Kef'ha. Sinaku'a and Lunamor were both part of a family group that traveled to the Shattered Plains as part of Kef'ha's quest to win Shardplate from Torol Sadeas. However, Sadeas murdered Kef'ha without a proper duel. Lunamor stated that Sinaku'a and Tifi were among those killed after raising weapons in vengeance, likely after Sadeas seized Kef'ha's property and turned his family into servants.

When Tuaka was reunited with Lunamor, she asked after Sinaku'a and Tifi. Her reaction implied that they were Lunamor's older siblings and that their death meant that he had gained elevated status, possibly becoming nuatoma himself. However, Lunamor did not wish to discuss the matter, and Sinaku'a's identity was left ambiguous.</description>

When Dalinar Kholin attempted to bring Azir into his coalition, Snoxil's finger was brought out for the discussion as a reminder of the last time the Alethi came to Azir in force.</description>

- Sullik to Veil when he cuts off her alcohol

Sullik is the owner and bartender of the bar All's Alley in the Urithiru breakaway. He is a larger man, who may or may not be lighteyes and who wears a takama. He has hired a number of lower class lighteyed thugs, including Betha and Ur, to provide protection for his bar.

He is aware of the murders that occurred near the bar and is wary of authority figures looking into the incident out of fear that they would shut down the bar.

He keeps Horneater white at the bar as a joke. He does not know what the liquor is made from, however, knows that it works well as paint stripper. He knows when to cut patrons off and has little tolerance for people who are likely to cause trouble in his bar.

When Shallan questioned him about the murders that occurred, he refused to tell her details and instead pointed her in the direction of his hired thugs.</description>

      <description>Shubreth-son-Mashalan is a historical conqueror on Roshar.

A young Gavilar references his rule along with the Sunmaker and the Hierocracy as examples of overstretching resources leading to collapse of empires soon after they're built. Shubreth was likely a leader of Shinovar during the Shin invasions.</description>

      <description>Brightlord Tanalan is is the citylord of Rathalas. He has a nasal accent, common in the Rifters.

He once played pawns with Dalinar and lost, paying the bet with a hundred glowing rubies each in a bottle of wine.

When Gavilar attacked the rift, Tanalan was in possession of the shardblade Oathbringer. He tried to duel Dalinar, but was quickly brought down by a surprise charge. When Tanalan's soldiers tried to kill Dalinar, he brought down the platform they were fighting on, mortally wounding Tanalan in the process. He was then brought to a secret hideout with his wife and child, but Dalinar followed him and ended him there, taking his shardblade but sparing his son.

After his death his son Tanalan took his title and continued the rebellion, culminating in the burning of Rathalas.</description>

      <description>"One showed the time with three hands—even seconds, as if that mattered. The other was a stormclock, which could be set to wind down to the next projected highstorm."

- Dalinar describing Navani's vambrace

A stormclock is a device from Roshar which can be used to tell when a highstorm is due. It's composed of a single arm on a round face, and some hidden mechanisms.

Rather than a clock, it's more akin to a timer. The user must wind it up for the amount of time they predict is left until a highstorm. The stormclock then counts down the time and makes a small dinging sound upon finishing. As such, it can be used to count down until other things as well, such as the arrival of the Everstorm.

While regular Rosharan timepieces are fabrials, it's uncertain whether stormclocks are as well or if they work purely mechanically.

The stormclocks have existed on Roshar for some time, but Navani Kholin is the first to create a version small enough to wear on one's wrist. She designs a leather vambrace that combines a stormclock with a regular fabrial clock and a painrial, and gifts it to several people, among them Dalinar and Adrotagia.</description>

      <description>Spheres are the primary currency in most nations on Roshar. Each one consists of a gemstone encased in a glass bead. Gemstones, including the ones in spheres, can temporarily hold Investiture in the form of Stormlight, offering both a source of light and fuel for Surgebindings. Like all gemstones, spheres naturally leak any Stormlight they have absorbed, over a period of about a week. This has led to the practice of leaving spheres out during highstorms so they can be recharged. Rosharans use the terms infused and dun to differentiate between spheres that hold Stormlight at the moment, and ones that have gone dark. They were first devised as an alternative to large open flames, as Roshar's atmosphere has a high oxygen content, making flames behave somewhat differently.</description>

It is presumed that she lives near her namesake Smolderbrand Channel in the Sea of Oracles, a subsection of the southern Sea of Lost Lights. The channel's location corresponds to a tributary of the Deathbend River in the Eastern Crownlands of Alethkar in the Physical Realm.

At some point near the advent of the True Desolation, Nazh encountered Smolderbrand and stole a.</description>

      <description>The tenasi are a race of aliens and, at the time of Starsight, one of the five main species of the Superiority. They discovered cytonics just after beginning to use steam power, and, like all other alien species known to humankind, quickly refocused their efforts on developing their cytonic powers. At some point, they discovered how to suppress cytonic abilities and began using that power to lock away any discontents, which resulted in their being considered to be of primary intelligence.

In the days before it was due to go bankrupt, the Phone Company heard a few squeaks through its prototype cytonic communication machine. Those noises attracted the attention of the tenasi, who sent a response -- Earth's first contact with an alien species -- and dispatched a ship to make contact. As such, they are the first alien race encountered by humankind.

In what became known as the tenasi incident, a tenasi diplomatic vessel, which was one of the most powerful non-human ships in the galaxy at the time, was accidentally shot down by the United Governments military, making for an embarrassing second contact. The humans, however, were unaware that this was the most powerful alien ship and the Phone Company stepped in with its cytonic technology to negotiate a peace. The result was the Tenasi Agreement, which, in return for the peace settlement, made the Phone Company entirely above the law, gave it exclusive rights to all alien FTL communication technology, and granted it the right to function as the sole intermediaries between aliens and humankind.

Hundreds of years later, when the Superiority is formed, the tenasi still have a prominent place in the galaxy and become one of the five main species in charge of the Superiority, though there are very few tenasi present on Starsight. Unlike the other species in the Superiority, the tenasi have the ability to fight without becoming emotional. As a result, nearly all of the Superiority's drone pilots are tenasi, though there are some varvax as well.</description>

      <description>The Tenasi Agreement is an agreement between tenasi and humans from the year 2071. After the Phone Company accidentally used cytonic technology to contact the tenasi, the United Governments accidentally shot down the resulting tenasi diplomatic ship. Humanity was thrown into chaos and uncertainty. In exchange for peaceful negotiations with the tenasi, the Phone Company received extralegal status and sole control of human cytonic communications technology.

The document of the Tenasi Agreement is available to be read by United Intelligence Bureau operatives, and perhaps by regular citizens. There are many holovids, commentaries, and newscasts from or talking about this time in human history.

Coln Abrams believed there was some hidden truth behind the Tenasi Agreement that the public did not know about. In some sense he was right, as few people knew that the ship shot down by humanity was one of the most advanced in the galaxy, and alien technology was inferior to that of humans.</description>

He remarked that he thought she was faking, as she was so uncoordinated that Rusko would not have hired her, no matter how pretty her legs were. Lessie was embarrassed but said that she was working undercover, and refused to discuss it any further.</description>

Spensa's great-grandmother is an engineer on the Defiant and the fleet's cytonic hyperdrive. She is married to Spensa's great-grandfather the mother of Becca Nightshade.

Due to her cytonic abilities, as well as by virtue of being part of the engineers of the Defiant, Spensa's great-mother is resented and feared by the other occupants of the fleet. Gran-Gran implies her mother was the only cytonic aboard the Defiant, and the only one able to jump the fleet using faster than light travel.</description>

      <description>This page is a collection of quotes about the ten fools.

"We must have seemed of the ten fools, charging away like that. I do wish you'd given me more notice to prepare your honor guard. This is a war zone."

- Dalinar, to Elhokar, after climbing the rock

"I apologize for wasting your time, Brightlord. You are correct; this is akin to the ten fools."

- Teleb, concerning lighter bridges to Dalinar

"Kal leaned back, breathing in and out. He felt like one of the ten fools—specifically Cabine, who acted like a child though he was adult."

- Kaladin, when he is sent to the kitchens as his father speaks to Roshone

"I know, that was before I saw him rescue Sadeas. Every time I start to forget how amazing my father is, he does something to prove me one of the ten fools."

- Adolin

"They'll see me dead, like my father. Sometimes I do wonder if we're chasing after the ten fools here. The assassin in white—he was Shin."

- Elhokar

"They're worthless, you know. You're of the ten fools, Dalinar Kholin! Don't you see how mad you are? This will be remembered as the most ridiculous decision ever made by an Alethi highprince."

- Torol Sadeas, in reference to Dalinar trading his Shardblade for the bridgemen

"Kaladin felt like one of the ten fools. Actually, he felt like all of them. Ten times an idiot. But most specifically Eshu, who spoke of things he did not understand in front of those who did."

- Kaladin

"I've been played for one of the ten fools, Moash thought, chin to his chest. And I don't even know how."

- Moash

"Amaram could not help being reminded of the last time he had visited this place, in the company of someone who had been playing him for one of the ten fools all along."

- Amaram

"Ten large glyphs, written directly on the stone of the floor running up to the dais with the king’s Common Throne. The glyphs listed the ten foolish attributes, as represented by the ten fools. Beside each glyph was a written paragraph in women’s script explaining how the queen exemplified each of the fools."

- Pai's denouncement of Aesudan

"She'd begun to imagine an infinite spiral, like with old Dilid, one of the ten fools. He ran up a hillside toward the Tranquiline Halls with sand sliding beneath his feet—running for eternity, but never making progress."

- Shallan

"Probably not. So often, she’s right, and you just end up feeling like one of the ten fools."

- Renarin talking to Shallan about Jasnah

"It's nothing against you and your people. But I’ve made a life out of traveling to difficult places to trade, and even my babsk said that trying to trade with the Horneaters was akin to the seventh fool."

- Rysn Ftori talking to Cord

"Adolin held his gaze. Kaladin tried to form the words, and felt of the ten fools when he couldn't get them out."

- Kaladin

"And, mark Kaladin as the fourth fool if Adolin didn't immediately pull out a gift for the pair."

- Kaladin, about Adolin

"Don't play the sixth fool, Father," Kaladin said. "You can’t let them take you after this."

- Kaladin to Lirin</description>

- Gran-Gran telling Spensa of her father

Spensa's great-grandfather is a historian aboard the Defiant. He is married to Spensa's great-grandmother and father to Becca Nightshade.

By virtue of being part of the engineering corp, Spensa's great-grandfather, is resented and feared by the other occupants of the Defiant. As Gran-Gran implies her mother was the only cytonic aboard the Defiant, it is likely that her father did not possess the defect.</description>

She was a puppeteer or animator Epic. Her only known power was to give "life" to marionettes and enable them movement without being attached to any strings. Dean Knighthawk's Epic-based mannequin, Manny, was made using some of The Wooden Soul's DNA. She died ten years prior to the events of Calamity.</description>

      <description>The storage caverns are five caches of supplies left behind by the Lord Ruler, hidden in caverns beneath cities in the Final Empire.

Every cache contains a metal plate with inscriptions, providing the location of the next cavern and some advice or information from the Lord Ruler. All hold a large supply of food and grain, but each one also has its own specialty.

The first cavern discovered is beneath Luthadel itself. The other caverns are in Statlin City, Urteau, Vetitan, and Fadrex City and discovered in this order.

Each cavern is in a rocky area, near metal mines, beneath a building of the Steel Ministry. The metal underground shields the caches from Ruin, to prevent him from discovering them.

All caches are in or near the Central Dominance, with Luthadel's cavern in the center and the other four forming a box around it.

Every discovered cache is bigger than the previous one. The Lord Ruler started constructing them eight hundred years into his reign.</description>

The Slatra has multiple shield igniters that allows for it to constantly have a barrier surrounding its cargo or passengers. They are bulky ships that are not suitable in battle against the Krell as they are slower and more cumbersome than enemy vehicles.

Spensa trained on a Slatra during flight school. She thought it was inferior to M-Bot, and found it to be slow and commonplace.</description>

- Evi on the origins of spren

Shishi is an entity mentioned by Evi Kholin, who attributes the mysterious circumstances by which spren do or do not appear to Shishi.

It is unclear who or what Shishi is. It may be a being of Iriali religion or folk tradition; perhaps a different name or aspect of their deity, the One. Evi is Riran but she is known to believe in the Iriali concept of the One, and she considers the mysteries of the natural world to be given to humankind by Shishi. As she later states that all mysteries are resolved once people rejoin the One, it's possible that Shishi and the One are separate entities.

Alternatively, Evi is also known to believe in some aspects of Vorinism and uses unique Riran names for the Heralds, such as "Yaysi" for Jezrien and "Kellai" for Kalak. "Shishi" could therefore be another name for Shalash or Ishar.</description>

They have a tradition of Soulcasting their favorite servants into statues post-mortem, decorating the mansion's grand hall with it, which is where its name came from. In addition, they are said to be extremely wealthy, with numerous riches hidden within their home.

      <description>Shum is a plant on Roshar.

The appearance and properties of the plant are unknown. It is presumably grown in Jah Keved, as Lin Davar traded in raw shum. Lin was at one point forced to sell raw shum, along with breachtree cotton, to Revilar at a devastating discount in order to gain influence. Revilar's interest in shum implies that it can be used to create textiles.</description>

      <description>"The solquis are a longtime member of the Superiority. Stalwart and loyal to our ideals though they are, their species has been turned down for primary citizenship over two dozen times."

- Cuna

The solquis are one of the member species of the Superiority.

There are roughly humanoid, but blue-skinned and with numerous tentacles on their heads that they bend and move around to form expressions. They seem to have one pair of legs, but in lieu of arms, they have long, wiggly limbs that split into two tentacles at the ends. They are naturally docile and easygoing, and seem to prefer moving around in pairs. When translated by pins, they have deep voices.

Solquis have been one of the older members of the Superiority, and are considered highly loyal to its cause. However, their perceived lack of intelligence has kept them from receiving primary citizenship. They seem to be fairly common on Starsight; Spensa is welcomed on the station by a solquis dock worker, and a few pairs of them attempt Superiority's pilot test alongside her. Winzik believes that, calm and docile as they are, they'd make excellent soldiers, but is yet to be proven right or wrong.</description>

It is captained by Hesho until his death, after which Kauri assumes command. The starfighter is 50% larger than the average Superiority starfighter due to the large crew of kitsen it accommodates, and is built like a battleship.</description>

      <description>The Sterrion 36 is a handgun on Scadrial, crafted by Ranette for Waxillium Ladrian.

The Sterrion is a double action, six chamber revolver with an unadorned steel-alloy frame. It is not fancy, with an un-exotic grip, but is reliable with tight tolerances and no play in the cylinder. It is capable of shooting large-caliber bullets. The barrel is long and hard to conceal, meant to be carried in a side holster as opposed to under the arm. As a lawman in the Roughs, Wax typically carried two and wielded them at the same time. After moving back to Elendel from the Roughs, Wax placed them in storage along with his shotgun and mistcoat. Wax was able to recover the pistols with some assistance from Harmony during his raid on the Vanishers hideout.</description>

      <description>The Terringul 27 is a type of gun on Scadrial. It is not a particularly high caliber gun, but has a long barrel, which makes it more accurate. A Terringul 27 fits strapped to the inside of Waxillium Ladrian's calf.

When attacking the Vanishers hideout, Wax uses a Terringul 27 loaded with hollow-point bullets, which he likes as they lodge into things, giving him good anchors for Steelpushing and reduce the chance of the bullets going through his targets and injuring bystanders.</description>

      <description>Soldier Field is an old football stadium that the Reckoners used to fight Steelheart in.

There is nothing of real importance around Soldier Field, and thus usually no one goes near it. Like the rest of the city, it was turned to steel during the Great Transfersion.

The Reckoners use Soldier Field as a place to fight Steelheart. They create nooks and sniper nests using the tensors, and replace the old headlights (which were turned to steel) with new UV headlights.</description>

      <description>The Reckoners is a board game created by Nauvoo Games, based on the setting and characters from The Reckoners books. The game is played cooperatively by up to six players who take on the roles of the various members of the Reckoners. Their overall goal is to discover the weakness of Steelheart and assassinate him, but there are also other Epics present in the game who must be dealt with.

"Players must defeat Steelheart and other ruthless ‘Epics’ – the equivalent of supervillains – that each have unique, game-impacting abilities. Players must cooperate and decide how to resolve these competing priorities to eliminate Epics, save Newcago, and ultimately win the game. How, when, and where players act will determine victory or failure."

- Nauvoo Games

An expansion, Steelslayer, has been announced, and began its Kickstarter campaign on September 10th, 2020; it will feature two new "boss" epics, Regalia and Limelight, as well as two new settings, Babilar and Ildithia.</description>

Shuanor's soldiers were stationed on the upper floors of Urithiru when Raboniel compromised the tower's defenses and the singer forces invaded. He was one of the few officers present in the command center when Queen Navani and Battalionlord Teofil were deciding on the best course of action. After Navani decided to focus on an incursion into the crystal pillar room, Teofil directed Shuanor and Gavri to withdraw their troops to safer locations while Radathavian led a harrying force to cover their retreat.</description>

      <description>The Song of Prayer is a song that can be used by singers to create Voidlight spheres.

The role of the song in the creation of Voidlight spheres is unknown. However, Navani's research into the pure tones of Roshar allowed her to manipulate Voidlight, even mixing it with other Lights inside of a sphere. The tone and rhythm of the Song of Prayer is therefore likely related to the creation of Voidlight spheres.

Odium's forces are not seen using the Song of Prayer in battle, even when they are running low on Voidlight. It is unclear why this is the case, but Fused and Regals seem to have abundant spheres available to them and it may be easier or faster to simply retrieve more spheres rather than create new ones. Venli knew that singing the Song of Prayer could draw Odium's attention, and did not dare to try and create her own Voidlight spheres during the occupation of Urithiru.</description>

      <description>The Song of Mornings is a listener song. It is simple, and is meant to train young children for more complex rhythms and songs. Venli finds it satisfying, because since it is simple, you can add complexity to it, and sing the song's soul instead of just worrying about getting its lyrics and notes right. It is Jaxlim's favorite song.</description>

Few among all the listener families know the song, Jaxlim being one of them. As a result, paper is precious and rare among the listeners. With the song, Jaxlim helps Eshonai perfect the process of making paper.</description>

      <description>Wyrn is the title given to the emperor of Fjorden and the leader of the Derethi church on Sel. The title is based on the founder of Fjorden, who was named Wyrn.

The Wyrn resides in a palace in Widor which is called Zigareth.

According to the doctrine of Shu-Dereth, the Wyrn is the only individual that can serve Jaddeth directly. All other members of the church are bound to other members of the religious hierarchy below Wyrn, with him at the top and the Gyorns and Gragdets directly beneath him.

The current Wyrn, Wulfden the Fourth, perpetrated the Invasion of Arelon. Recent Wyrns have also used seons for communication, entrusted one to each of their gyorns so that any gyorn would be able to contact them and discuss important matters, even when seperated by incredibly long distances. This was a matter of utter secrecy, since the seons are believe to be Elantrian constructs. One such seon was used by Hrathen to communicate with Wyrn Wulfden during his mission in Kae. The seons were kept locked away in strongboxes to ensure their secrecy while not being used, and the Wyrn's own personal seon was attended to by a mute servant at all times.</description>

      <description>"That was an illusion, a dream. I am that child who grew up in the shadows."

- Vin.

Vin is a half-skaa Mistborn from the Final Empire on Scadrial. She later becomes known as Heir to the Survivor, the Ascendant Warrior and the Lady Mistborn, as well as taking on the alias Valette Renoux. She was born to Tevidian Tekiel's skaa mistress in year 1005 in Luthadel, and was raised by her half brother Reen after he discovered that their sister had been murdered by their mother. The two lived on the streets and worked in the underground, until eventually coming to work in Camon's crew.

Vin trains in and works with Kelsier's crew after he prevents Camon from beating her to death, and infiltrates the nobility under the guise of Valette Renoux, eventually helping to save the survivors of the skaa rebellion's army and killing Shan Elariel before fighting the Lord Ruler and killing him. After the Collapse, she marries Elend Venture and sets herself and Elend up as the empress and emperor of the New Empire, respectively, during the Siege of Luthadel, wherein she kills Zane and Straff Venture, saves the city from rampaging koloss and forces Lord Cett to swear his allegiance to them. In the aftermath of the siege, she inadvertently frees Ruin from its prison at the Well of Ascension.

Following Ruin's release, Vin helps to secure her and Elend's empire; locating the Lord Ruler's storage caverns, participating in the Siege of Fadrex City, and takes up the Shard Preservation shortly prior to the Battle of Hathsin, wherein she gives her life to kill Ruin. In the years following the Final Ascension, she becomes a mythical figure to the descendants of the survivors, known as the Ascendant Warrior. In the Words of Founding, it is said that she became the guardian of the mists and now watches over people in the night.</description>

A year after the Collapse, she traveled to Luthadel at Sazed's wish in order to train Elend Venture in leadership. She quickly became a member of Elend's inner circle. After this, she and Sazed studied the rubbing he made of Kwaan's inscription, and during that time they became romantically involved. She died during the Siege of Luthadel, slain by Koloss.</description>

      <description>Vorinism is the one of the primary religions of Roshar. It is most prevalent in Alethkar, Jah Keved, Kharbranth, New Natanan and Thaylenah, collectively known as the Vorin kingdoms, and becomes less common further west. The religion worships the Almighty, a deity based on Honor, and the ten Heralds.</description>

      <description>Urbene was a small village in the Eastern Dominance of the Final Empire on Scadrial.

The village consisted of ten large wooden hovels built in a loose circle with a well in the center, and a nobleman's manor a little farther up the valley. The skaa of Urbene were herdsmen. The village itself lay in a quiet hollow amid the rising landscape. It was described as picturesque.

Sazed visited Urbene on his way to Luthadel. He found the village full of corpses of skaa that had died from starvation and dehydration. They were too scared to leave their hovels as the mists were out during the day, and had already killed skaa like Jell who went outside. Only one of them survived because of cannibalism, and this crazed villager explained Sazed what had happened there.</description>

      <description>"I am Truthless. I do as my master requires, and I do not ask for an explanation."

- Szeth, regarding his oath

The Truthless are the lowest social class among the people of Shinovar. The underlying meaning of the word "Truthless" is similar to "liar", but not quite the same.

A Truthless is a slave to anyone who holds their Oathstone; rather than being bound by the tenets of their faith, they are obligated to obey the commands of their master in all things except for taking their own life and, in the case of Szeth-son-son-Vallano, giving up his Honorblade. Most outsiders consider Truthless highly valuable due to their great obedience, but they are considered worthless by the Shin, who cannot accept any payment for a Truthless, even if it is pressed upon them.

Being named Truthless is used as a terrible punishment by the Shin. Truthless have to bear the guilt of all the deeds that they are commanded to do -- even though they must obey their masters, they are not absolved of the guilt of their actions, as outsiders commonly believe they are. Being prohibited from taking their own lives is part of the punishment as well, as it helps extend their suffering as long as possible.

The concept of the Truthless likely originates in the beliefs of Stone Shamanism: Szeth avoids questioning the tenets of Stone Shamanism out of fear that that would lead him to question his status as Truthless.</description>

Some of these are written novels that have been "trunked", some of which have been re-written or cannibalized from. Some are ideas Brandon has talked about briefly but it is unknown if they will ever actually be written. The remainder are forthcoming works that, while unwritten, will come out eventually.

      <description>Urteau was the capital city of the Northern Dominance in the Final Empire.

It was known for its "streetslots," dried up canals that served as streets. It was the ancestral home of House Venture.

After the fall of the Lord Ruler, Quellion, also known as the Citizen, seized power by invoking Kelsier's authority as Lord of the Mists.

It was the location of one of the Lord Ruler's storage caverns.

Unlike the other cities in the Final Empire, Urteau had a rich nightlife. This was because Quellion ruled by invoking Kelsier, who had said that the mists wouldn't hurt people and because Quellion himself preached that the mists were of Kelsier. Thus, not a lot could be done to prevent the nightlife.</description>

      <description>"It seems odd, to me, that you should work so hard during the Lord Ruler's time, always wearing your metalminds in secret, despite the danger. Yet, now that you are free to do as you wish, you carry them in your pack"

- Vedlew to Sazed

Vedlew is a Terrisman elder from Scadrial.

Vedlew is the senior elder of the Terris refugees staying at the Pits of Hathsin after the Collapse of the Final Empire. Sazed questions him and the other Terris leaders about the daymists. They tell him that the mistsickness does not affect the Terris people, and that they think it is a myth.

Vedlew wonders why Sazed no longer openly wears his metalminds, and he and the others wish for Sazed to stay with the Terrismen and lead them.</description>

He was a member of Ashweather Cett's army that attacked Luthadel. He was on mist duty with Jarloux when Vin and Zane attacked Keep Hasting. He was the sole survivor of his squad of forty men.

After Cett swore allegiance to Elend Venture, he was reemployed as a guard in Luthadel. He and Rittle met with TenSoon playing Kelsier, and told him of the madness afflicting King Penrod. When TenSoon asks after the whereabouts of Elend and Vin Wellen instead relays the location of Lord Breeze; in Urteau. TenSoon leaves them with the advice to find shelter from the mists in the Arguois caverns. Elend questions him and Rittle in the refugee camp after having led the people out of Luthadel.</description>

      <description>"They are aflame. They burn. They bring the darkness when they come, and so all you can see is that their skin is aflame. Burn, burn, burn...."

- Collected on Palahishev, 1172, 21 seconds pre-death. Subject was a baker's apprentice.

The Voidbringers are historically considered to be a group of creatures that attacked the humans of Roshar in a series of wars known as Desolations. In the four and a half millennia since Aharietiam, much of the factual evidence on the Voidbringers has faded into myth and legend, as well as Vorin doctrine. Voidbringers were said to have cast mankind out of the Tranquiline Halls and fought the Heralds of the Almighty and Knights Radiant on Roshar.

Despite the fact that the Voidbringers were mostly dismissed as legends and folklore, the scholar Jasnah Kholin feared what was to come and tried to surmise the true nature of Voidbringers, hypothesizing that the singers were the Voidbringers. In actuality, upon the arrival of the Everstorm, the Voidbringers were revealed to be a large coalition of various beings allied with the Shard Odium--not solely singers. Furious at their displacement and slavery at the hands of mankind, the Voidbringers are intent on taking Roshar for themselves.</description>

      <description>"Vorinism taught that the finest warriors would have the holy privilege of joining the Heralds after death, fighting to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls from the Voidbringers."

- Highprince Dalinar Kholin's thoughts on the Tranquiline Halls

In Vorin doctrine, the Tranquiline Halls are the original home of mankind, as well as the heaven to which those who are worthy go when they die. Vorinism holds that humans were driven from the Tranquiline Halls by the Voidbringers, but with the help of the Heralds they are fighting to take back their home.</description>

      <description>Vo was a man from Chedesh who was the first Returned on Nalthis.

Like most Returned, he died a week after returning, leaving his wife to bear him an heir. His wife would later rule as queen and established the royal lineage, whose descendants belong to the Idrian royal family. It is indeed possible for Returned to bear children, but only when one has special means which have not been revealed yet, although the priesthood of the God King is aware of how to do so.

While the priesthood is aware of how to have a Returned successfully give birth, Siri assumes that it is impossible and that the story of Vo fathering a child was fabricated in order to legitimize the royal line of Hallandren Vasher mentions to Nightblood that the royal locks Vivenna exhibits are proof that she is indeed descended from a Returned and that she has a piece of a Returned in her.

Vo Returned and had the Five Visions while traveling the coast of Hallandren by boat. His shipmates founded the kingdom of Hanald in the lands of the Pahn Kahl.</description>

- Jasnah's opinion of Urithiru

Urithiru is a tower-city on Roshar that functioned as the home of the Knights Radiant and the central point of the Silver Kingdoms during the Heraldic Epochs. In the present day, it serves as the headquarters of the forces opposing Odium, including the refounded Knights Radiant, as well as the remaining Alethi soldiers and nobility. The current Queen of Alethkar rules from Urithiru.</description>

      <description>Tu Bayla is a nation on Roshar.

Ru Parat and Fu Namir are cities in the region. It borders Jah Keved to the east, the Reshi Sea to the north, a mountain range to the south, and shares land borders with Yulay and Marabethia to the west, as well as forming the eastern coast of the Purelake. It seems to have at least one river that runs into the Purelake and another that runs into the Reshi Sea, and may also claim some of the Reshi isles close to its coast. It is formed from parts of the Silver Kingdoms of Sela Tales and Valhav.

Its people are nomadic. Tyn grew up there. Urithiru lays in the mountain ranges to the south of Tu Bayla.

When Yanagawn commented on the similarities between Gavilar and the Sunmaker he refers to the Alethi as being organized in tribes, and Dalinar retorts that the Alethi aren't the same as the nomads that live in Tu Bayla. Before the Battle of Thaylen Field, the Urithiru coalition contemplate invading Tu Bayla to counter possible invasions into Jah Keved, which threatened to split the coalition's territory in two.</description>

      <description>A Twinborn is a Metalborn with at least one Allomantic power and one Feruchemical power.

Notable Twinborn included Waxillium Ladrian, Wayne, and Miles Dagouter.

Twinborn only began to appear after the Final Ascension, due to the intermingling of the Terris people with the other citizens of the Final Empire. This mingling also had the effect of diluting Feruchemical power, creating Ferrings. The interaction of Feruchemy and Allomancy in a single person allows for practical benefits of the power (Bloodmakers healing in a time bubble, Coinshots augmenting their weight with Feruchemical iron), etc.

It should be noted however, that it is difficult to be born a Mistborn and full Feruchemist. This is due to fact that they share portions of the individual's "spiritual DNA", thus preventing a full manifestation of both abilities. Whether this means someone can be born a full Mistborn and Ferring or full Feruchemist and Misting is yet to be determined.</description>

They were lead by Miles Dagouter. Tarson is second in command.

They attacked many trains, making the cargo disappear. They employed a number of novel technologies including a train equipped with a projection system. This was used to stop the oncoming train by appearing on a collision course. They then used a canal-based crane to steal the carriage and replace it with an empty replica.</description>

Yulay's territory primarily consists of a narrow strip of land between the southern shore of the Purelake and several mountainous areas. It borders Tu Bayla to the east and Babatharnam to the west. The southern border with Azir is mostly defined by mountains, with the exception of one large pass, which has the towns of Benru and Berqq at the border.

Other notable locations in Yulay are Yian Dion, Domistar, and Uarr Dion, all of which are on the shores of the Purelake.

Before the return of the Knights Radiant, some people in Yulay talked about them and hoped that they would return.

During the Silver Kingdoms era, Yulay was part of Sela Tales.</description>

      <description>The Wandersail was a possibly fictional ship on the world of Roshar.

It was captained by Derethil, who had it built to travel through Highstorms. It was nearly destroyed, shipwrecked on an island in the middle of the ocean (Uvara), by a giant whirlpool "where, it is said, the ocean drains" and later it is mentioned that it was fixed in the Uvara shipyards. Eventually, Derethil and his remaining crew left on the Wandersail, using the momentum of the whirlpool to get them away from it.

The story of Derethil and the Wandersail was told to Kaladin by Hoid. The tale appears to be known in Thaylenah as well, as Vstim gifts a newly built ship named after the Wandersail to his former apprentice Rysn. Among the Thaylen, consensus seems to be that the legendary ship and the events surrounding it are fictional.</description>

      <description>"She killed my baby sister, slaughtered her. And that same day she gave me this, one of her own earrings. As if…as if choosing me over my sister. A punishment for one, a twisted present for another."

- Vin telling Elend about her sister's death

Vin's sister is a Seeker who was killed during infancy. Her powers were stolen via Hemalurgy and given, unknowingly, to her sister, Vin. She is the daughter of a skaa woman and Tevidian Tekiel, the full sister of Vin, and the half sister of Reen.</description>

      <description>Vin's mother is a skaa prostitute in Luthadel. She uses Vin's sister to Hemalurgically charge a bronze spike. She then spikes Vin with this bronze 'earring', which later gives her the power to pierce copperclouds. She was found by Reen while covered in her nameless daughter's blood and proclaiming Vin a queen.

She was under the influence of Ruin, and he was able to influence her due to her own insanity.</description>

- Vin explaining how she got the earring to Marsh

Vin's earring is a simple piece, a small, silver-plated bronze stud. Vin wears it from her sister's death until Marsh rips it out just prior to her Ascension. It is also a Hemalurgic spike that enhances Vin's Allomantic bronze.</description>

      <description>Valath is a city in Jah Keved next to the Horneater Peaks.

It is likely in Valam princedom, maybe even the capital.

Valath is the location of the Holy Enclave, and though the Palanaeum has more tomes and scrolls, the Holy Enclave clearly has many tomes themselves.

Lin Davar sends Rin, one of his guards, to Valath to kill Helaran. Helaran left a contact in Valath so Balat could get in contact with him.

Shallan sent a message to her brothers via Valath.

The curates from the Holy Enclave travel to Vedenar to excommunicate Dalinar Kholin.</description>

- Jasnah on being a Veristitalian

The Veristitalians are an order of scholars on Roshar.

Veristitalians wish to create unbiased, factual accounts of the past in order to understand the present and be prepared for the future. In their opinion most historians don't write about the events but try to show the most adulating picture of themselves and their motives. Each one chooses a project they feel is misrepresented or misunderstood to study.

Jasnah Kholin, Ethid, and Jochi are Veristitalians.</description>

      <description>"The Tower was wedge-shaped, uneven, with the southeastern point rising far into the air, creating a steep hillside."

- Kaladin's observations

The Tower is one of the largest plateaus on the Shattered Plains on Roshar. It is the furthest easterly plateau discovered by the Alethi forces. It is oddly shaped, unusually massive, and chasmfiends seem to be fond of using it for pupating.

The Alethi Highprinces were beaten 29 times, never winning a skirmish on the Tower. Dalinar lost there twice alone and once on a joint attack with Torol Sadeas.

The Battle of the Tower occurred here.</description>

- From the Diagram, Book of the 2nd Desk Drawer: paragraph 14

The Unmade are a group of nine ancient and twisted spren on Roshar comprised of Splinters of Odium. They are regarded as minions of Odium, but not all of them continue to do his bidding. While they are traditionally depicted as personifications of destruction or forces, some of them are cognizant individuals. Each Unmade is endowed with vast and terrible powers, although the intelligence of the Unmade vary drastically.</description>

- Traxil, line 33, from Jasnah's notebook

Yelig-nar, also known as Blightwind, is one of the Unmade, an ancient and terrible spren of Odium. Unlike many of the Unmade, Yelig-nar does not appear to have a physical form, seemingly reliant on a bonding with a human or singer, granting his host a variety of abilities. Most recently, Yelig-nar joined with Meridas Amaram to fight in the Battle of Thaylen Field. Exactly what level of intelligence Yelig-nar himself has is uncertain, as the people he bonds with appear to remain fully in control of themselves.</description>

He participates in the first bridge run Kaladin actively leads, and with Dunny & Malop are the last to arrive to the bridge. After Gaz changes Bridge Four to be on chasm duty, and some of the bridgemen start talking to one another in the chasms, Yake is amongst those who stay quiet but take notice of the camaraderie. He is wounded in the arm during one bridge run, leaving Bridge Four only twenty-eight capable members. When Maps dies, he dismisses the Death Rattle as "just dying delirium".

When Kaladin is training Bridge Four how to fight with the spear, he sends Moash to help Yake and Hobber with their thrusts.

Yake, Moash, Teft and Kaladin train with Zahel and Ivis, learning how to deal with Shardblades and use stances.

He is among Kaladin's squires during a training session and greets Rlain and suggests he try to educate the new recruits, and then queried him about the Fused attacking caravans.</description>

      <description>"Anak malah kaf, del makian habin yah"

- A line from the Dawnchant, meaning, "To be human is to want that which we cannot have."

The Vanrial were an order of artists on Roshar who lived on the slopes of the Silent Mount in Jah Keved. For centuries they sang a song in a language whose meaning had been lost. The Vanrial claimed that the song had been given to them by the Heralds. Some evidence suggested that the lyrics themselves were in the Dawnchant.

There is also a theory that was known as the Vanrial Hypothesis; what it postulates is unknown.

The Vanrial were also responsible for preserving the full text of The Way of Kings from earlier times in Roshar's history when many other classical works were lost.</description>

      <description>"So the night will reign, for the choice of honor is life..."

- Valam's final words

Valam is a Veden highprince on Roshar.

House Davar owed Valam fealty. However, around the time of Shallan Davar's hunt for Jasnah Kholin, Valam's health was failing him, and he no longer provided the Davars with the same protection as he used to, which led to Shallan's desperate move to attempt to steal Jasnah's Soulcaster.

He emerged as the ruler of Jah Keved after the murder of King Hanavanar and the other Highprinces by Szeth. After his victory in the civil war that all but destroyed Vedenar, he was visited on his deathbed by Taravangian, who he named heir to the throne. He then had his bastard son Redin kill him so he would suffer no longer.</description>

      <description>Torfin is a member of Bridge Four on Roshar.

He has been a member of Bridge Four since its origins as a wartime bridge running crew under Torol Sadeas. After the crew is sent on chasm duty in the Shattered Plains to loot Parshendi corpses, they are quiet and nervous, but Kaladin engages Torfin, Drehy, and other members of the crew in conversation to break the tension. Torfin is later seen training with the rest of Bridge Four in the warcamps. When Moash abruptly stops carrying a bridge, Torfin yells at him, not realizing that Moash stopped due to his shock at seeing Kaladin's rapid recovery after his judgement by the highstorm.

After Kaladin swears the Third Ideal of the Order of Windrunners, Torfin becomes one of his squires. He is able to breathe in Stormlight whenever Kaladin is nearby, giving him healing powers and the ability to fly using the Surge of Gravitation. Unfortunately, he is scared of heights.</description>

- Took speaking of Szeth

Took is a darkeyed transient worker in Bavland and one of Szeth's former masters.

He speaks in a Bav dialect and wears dirty, ragged clothing. Took appears to consider himself superior to Szeth on the basis of ethnicity. Unlike most of Szeth's masters, who eventually grow uncomfortable with Szeth's obedience, Took considers it natural for Szeth to obey. He calls Szeth a child due to the his Shin ethnicity.

Took traded a farmer for Szeth in exchange for a sack of seeds, but fabricated a story about Szeth swearing to serve him his entire life. Though Took viewed himself as a seasoned traveler, he mainly cycled through the same towns in every few years. He typically stayed in poorer districts, too cheap to pay for anything finer, and frequented local bars in hopes of free drinks in exchange for wild stories--his finest being a tale in which he stole a sphere from the Nightwatcher that glowed black at night. Took would also use Szeth to impress the bars' patrons. On one evening, in the company of Ton, Amark, and a few other acquaintances, he ordered Szeth to wound himself in order to impress the miners with Szeth's obedience. As the evening wore on, the pair eventually left the bar. Took was stabbed by Makkek and his thugs that night while drunkenly walking home.</description>

- Sigzil on the Worldsingers

The Worldsingers were an organization of storytellers and knowledge-givers on Roshar during the Era of Solitude. They traveled the world learning of other places and cultures and spreading tales of the places they had already been. They saw themselves as superior to traditional storytellers, charged by the Heralds to spread knowledge. They have a presence in Jah Keved, and Shallan Davar thought there might be one at a Middlefest fair. There are some ties between Worldsingers and the Terris Worldbringers, that may be related to Hoid.</description>

      <description>A ward is a female apprentice to a Vorin scholar on Roshar.

Wards seem to be a concept limited to Vorin lighteyes. A scholarly woman can take on one or more students and teach them numerous subjects, such as mathematics, logic, art or natural history. Such a teacher cannot be forced to accept a ward, and can set conditions that must be fulfilled before a prospective candidate is accepted. In exchange for education, the ward serves as a scribe and assistant to her teacher.

The wardship can be broken off at any point by either the teacher or the ward, but formally it ends only when the teacher decides that her student has at least met the minimum requirements of professional scholarship.</description>

- Yarda and King Dedelin discussing war

Yarda is the general of the Idrian armies. He is a burly man and had a thick beard. He is also an old friend of King Dedelin. Dedelin referred to him as "a harsh man born of harsh winters," but also as good of a man as Dedelin had ever known. Yarda would not hesitate to send one soldier to die if it meant that the rest of the army was in a better position to attack. Conferences with Yarda and Dedelin usually lasted hours.

Parlin is Yarda's son. Dedelin often wished Parlin could marry his daughter, Vivenna, but this was not possible, as Dedelin had made a treaty with Hallandren to send his daughter on Vivenna's twenty-second birthday.</description>

Shai forged a letter from the Bloodsealer to trick Yil. She made Yil believe that the Bloodsealer was collecting nails, hair, and personal items belonging to him and the other guards in order to take control of their bodies and kidnap someone. Yil and Hurli went and roughed the Bloodsealer up a bit, which resulted in him drinking too much and being too late to renew the stamp imprisoning Shai.

Shai believed that Yil and her other guards would be reassigned to a backwater guard post after she finished her work, possibly guarding passes to the Teo Peninsula.</description>

Vun Makak &mdash; his younger, spiteful brother &mdash; had to be tricked into thinking you worshiped him, otherwise he’d get jealous. It was only safe to speak of these things in a holy grotto."

- Ishikk on the Purelaker religion

Vun Makak is a deity in the religion of the people of the Purelake on Roshar.

Vun Makak is the younger brother of the true god of the Purelakers, Nu Ralik. Vun Makak is spiteful and jealous, and the Purelakers believe that they must trick him into thinking that they worship him instead of his brother. Therefore, they do not speak Nu Ralik's name outside of their holy grottos, always swearing by Vun Makak in their day-to-day interactions. "I swear it by Vun Makak, may he watch over me and curse me as he pleases."

- Ishikk

Vun Makak is usually thought to blight or curse his "followers", and he is also associated with lying. One man invokes his name after he is paralyzed by Szeth.</description>

Judging from the similarity of its name to Idris, Vendis could be a place in the mountains near Idris, and often raided the Idrians. However, it could also be a group of people, rather than a place or country.</description>

      <description>Trent Saxon was a chalkmaker employed by the Rithmatics department of Armedius Academy.

He is described as being "big and burly".

He took pride in his job as a chalkmaker, and he made chalk with special formulas for specific usages in Rithmatics.

Though not a Rithmatist, he is very interested in Rithmatic lines to a degree of obsession. He spends a lot of money to meet with professors of Rithmatics. He discovered a new kind of Rithmatic line, but didn't know its effects. Nobody knew it was a Rithmatic line until Joel recognized it in the Scribbler's drawings.

He was killed in a springrail accident while investigating a new Rithmatic line.</description>

      <description>Thomas York is the principal of Armedius Academy.

Despite being in charge of one of the eight Rithmatic Academies of the United Isles of America, he is notably not a Rithmatist.

He had a close relationship with Trent Saxon, Joel's father. After Trent died in a springrail accident, he awarded Joel a scholarship for free tuition so he could afford to attend Armedius.</description>

      <description>The Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner is the reception following the wedding of Joshin Yomen and Mi'chelle Ostlin.

Nearly the entirety of the Elendel upper class was invited to the event. Those who were not were specifically not invited to reinforce their outsider status in elite society; some of the upper class' least savory figures were also invited to maximize the insult to those who were not.

Wax and Steris Harms attend as the official start of their relationship. Jackstom Harms and Marasi both accompany Steris. Wayne gatecrashes as a waiter.

The Vanishers invade under the guise of daylight robbery, kidnapping both Steris and Marasi and killing Lord Peterus.

Wax and Wayne plan and execute a counter-attack, rescuing Marasi and forcing the Vanishers into retreat. The constabulary arrive and berate Wax for saving everyone.</description>

      <description>William Muns is a Rithmatist fighting at the Tower of Nebrask.

William is Melody's brother. They come from the Floridian Atolls where their parents still live. Both parents as well as William's and Melody's siblings are Rithmatists, which seemed to be nearly impossible.

He was believed to have died fighting the wild chalklings when he crossed the defensive lines at Nebrask. Professor Nalizar and some other Rithmatists tried to rescue him after they saw William swarmed by wild chalklings, but failed and never found his corpse.

He was actually consumed by the Scribbler and later released after it was defeated by Fitch, Joel, and Melody.</description>

He often goes through the motions of making sure all of Leeds' hallucinations are comfortable, and also fetches them from their rooms and, when they ask for refreshments or foodstuffs, pretends to give them to them. Wilson turns seventy and retires the day after Stephen found Sandra.

Wilson is not, however, a sycophant. He calls Stephen out for acting improperly or disrespectfully towards clients and visitors.</description>

      <description>The varvax are a race of aliens in the Milky Way. They discovered cytonics before developing computers and began to explore the galaxy by traveling through the nowhere and to make contact with other species. The Interspecies Monitoring Coalition considers them to be of primary intelligence because they are a peaceful society, though this is only because—like all other species of primary intelligence—they imprison any dissenters and suppress their cytonic abilities.

A group of varvax were ordered to capture and secure the surrender of the Defiant Fleet after the Third Human War, however, the humans escaped to Detritus. The varvax now maintain a space station close to the planet and act as guards to prevent the humans escaping. They often send drones to attack the Defiants in order to prevent them gaining too much technology. Before Spensa and M-Bot hacked their computer systems, the Defiants referred to them as the Krell.</description>

Varion is in his 50's with silver hair. He arrived for a ceremony in his honor wearing a grey uniform.

Varion is a tactical genius and spent decades conquering the galaxy in the name of the High Emperor. However, when that was completed, he turned on the Emperor, and began fighting the High Empire instead. With the powerful army and superior technologies he gained during his galactic conquest, the High Empire doesn't stand much chance. Foreseeing this, the empire cloned him and his clone is named Dennison, publicly known as his brother.

He committed suicide after Dennison simulated him losing, having never learned what failure felt like.

His flagship is the Voidhawk, which is of rather small size.</description>

It allows Harmony to communicate with Wax, speaking through Ruin and hearing Wax's thoughts through Preservation. Although the earring is made from a hemalurgic spike, it has very little charge and grants practically no abilities.

Wax has the earring reforged into a bullet, allowing him to shoot Bleeder with it and deliver a second spike into her body. This allows Harmony to take direct action against her.

It was given to him by the kandra MeLaan.</description>

      <description>Wyrn the King is an ancient three-thousand line poem written on Sel.

The poem is thought to be the oldest known work of literature on Sel, written before the holy book of Shu-Keseg, the Do-Kando. It is centered around the original Wyrn, the founder of Fjorden.

After Wulfden the First converted to Shu-Dereth, the original text of Wyrn the King was greatly altered by Fjordell priests to make the work seem more aligned with Derethi doctrine. Among other changes, these altered versions of the poem depict Wyrn as being Derethi and make frequent references to the importance of the Derethi god, Jaddeth.

Sarene discovers an unaltered version of the ancient poem in a copy of the book Seor's Encyclopedia of Political Myths in Elantris. The book disproves much of the rhetoric and propaganda of the Derethi church and uses the alteration of the poem as an example. The original poem makes no references to Shu-Dereth and depicts Jaddeth as a minor god associated with the rocks below the ground. Sarene remarks that Fjorden's priesthood would be greatly embarrassed if knowledge of their tampering became known.</description>

      <description>William Ann Montane is the fourteen year-old daughter of Silence Montane, who lives with and helps her mother in the running of a waystop in the Forests of Hell.

William Ann takes after her father in appearance, and is already taller than her mother by fourteen. She often complains of awkwardness or being too tall, but Silence thinks that these attributes imply that William Ann will be beautiful.

She helps her mother to kill Chesterton Divide and his men for their bounty, and to recover the body from Red Young, who later cuts them off at the Old Bridge and takes her hostage. She is pushed through a Shade by Red after he draws her blood.

Silence rushes her to the waystop and saves her life -- stopping her from being turned into a Shade -- by pouring a mixture of powdered silver and water down her throat and on her face. However, her left side is blackened in the process, leaving her hand and some of her toes in need of amputation.</description>

      <description>King Wednegon was a leader during the Lord Ruler's period of conquest after his Ascension. He ruled at least a place named Darrelnai, though that may have been the name of his kingdom. He was one of the last leaders after the Ascension that was able to resist the Lord Ruler in combat. Tindwyl and the Keepers had a biography of King Wednegon. Wednegon referred to the Lord Ruler as the Conqueror.

Wednegon's soldiers couldn't stand against the Lord Ruler's koloss, and suffered a big loss at FellSpire that they could not recover from. Wednegon did not blame his soldiers, instead blaming lack of food from the Deepness. Even though the Deepness had been defeated with the Ascension, its touch weakened Darrelnai's food supply. Wednegon's biographer seems to agree that their lack of food did lead to their demise. It is not clear how long Wednegon's forces survived after the Ascension, but if the Deepness affected their food supply so much, it must not have been very long after the Ascension.</description>

      <description>"Yelig-nar, called Blightwind, was one that could speak like a man, though often his voice was accompanied by the wails of those he consumed."

- A quote from Traxil's work

Traxil is a scholar on Roshar known to have written about the Unmade and Yelig-nar. Jasnah Kholin doubted the authenticity of the source material. Hessi disagreed with Jasnah's opinions, and endorsed the quote from Traxil.

"The Unmade were obviously fabrications of folklore. Curiously, most were not considered individuals, but instead personifications of kinds of destruction. This quote is from Traxil, line 33, considered a primary source, though I doubt its authenticity."

- Jasnah's critique of the above quote.

"Traxil mentions Yelig-nar, named Blightwind, in an oft-cited quote. Though Jasnah Kholin has famously called its accuracy into question, I believe it."

- Hessi discusses the above critique in Mythica.</description>

      <description>The women's script is an alphabetic writing system used in Vorin nations, such as Alethkar, Jah Keved, and Kharbranth, on Roshar. The script is a phonetic alphabet, meaning each symbol, or "grapheme", denotes a particular sound, or "phoneme", and is written left to right starting in the top left hand corner of a page. Each letter is determined by both shape and size. As is indicated by the name, it is almost exclusively used by women, as writing is considered a feminine pursuit. The women's script is distinctly different from glyphs, which are a more logographic writing system (albeit with a phonetic component), which men are also allowed to learn.</description>

He semi-regularly played shelldry with Milen Davenpleu, Rene and another person.

Toorim also alerted Kaladin to an unknown Veden Shardbearer, which killed him, along with Acis, Hamel, Raksha, Navar and eleven other members of Kaladin's squad. It was later discovered by Shallan Davar by identification of his Shardblade, in the current possession of Amaram, that the Veden Shardbearer was Helaran Davar.</description>

      <description>"It was a good religion, Master Kelsier. It focused on discovery and knowledge—to these people, the making of maps was a reverent duty. They believed that once all of the world was known, understood, and catalogued, men would ﬁnally ﬁnd peace and harmony."

- Sazed's description of the Truths of the Bennet to Kelsier

The Truths of the Bennet was the religion of the Bennet people, who on Scadrial during the classical era. It is one of the religions recorded in Sazed's copperminds

The Bennet were a high developed people that lived on islands in the south, possibly among the ones with volcanoes that Braches told Alendi about. They were accomplished seafarers and cartographers; some of their maps, presumably ones created after the Ascension of the Lord Ruler but before their culture was suppressed, were still being used by the Final Empire at the time of the Collapse.

The Truths of the Bennet considered mapmaking to be a sacred duty, and taught that, once the entire world was charted and understood, humans would find peace. It was designed to be practiced while at sea; a ship's captain also served as its minister and theological training was a prerequisite for commanding a ship. Sazed believes that few other people from the classical era adhered to ideals of peace and discovery in their religion as well as the Bennet did.

While they are planning to overthrow the Final Empire, Sazed suggests the Truths of the Bennet to Kelsier as a possible religion. Kelsier rejects it, saying he's not interested in "peace and harmony" right now, and asks about the Valla instead. During his Ascension, Sazed uses their maps of the world from before the Lord Ruler's Ascension, which were recorded in his metalminds, to undo the changes Rashek made to the landscape while he held the power of the Well of Ascension.</description>

      <description>Tia is a member of the Reckoners. She generally is on operations during missions and is the group's main researcher. She is the only one among the Reckoners to know Prof from before the arrival of Calamity. She is also one of the main people to get in touch with the Reckoner's contacts such as the Knighthawk Foundry. She offers to teach David her side of the Reckoners, but he refuses, as it means he wouldn't be able to do point duty any more.</description>

      <description>Yallard is the author of a book on Rithmatics which Professor Fitch lends to Joel Saxon.

"He determines that the Blad Defense should be banned from official duels and tournaments, but he's shortsighted. Four ellipsoid segments combined may not make a 'traditional' defensive Line of Warding, but it's very effective. If they ban it from duels because it's too powerful, then nobody will learn it, and they won't be able to use it in a battle if they need to."

      <description>Tiil is a young Arelene boy who became an Elantrian sometime after the Reod. When Raoden established New Elantris, Tiil and the approximately fifty other children were placed under the care of Matisse, who teaches them to draw Aons. During this time, he and the other children live in a building known as the Roost.

When Elantris is attacked by Fjordell soldiers, Matisse convinces him and Teor to help keep the younger children moving and quiet by claiming that, since her father is a soldier, she is as well, and they can be her "subcaptains" if they do what she tells them.</description>

      <description>"We have seen a curious phenomenon associated with rebel groups that break off of the Final Empire and attempt to seek autonomy. In almost all cases, the Lord Ruler didn’t need to send his armies to reconquer the rebels. By the time his agents arrived, the groups had overthrown themselves. It seems that the rebels found the chaos of transition more difficult to accept than the tyranny they had known before. They joyfully welcomed back authority—even oppressive authority—for it was less painful for them than uncertainty."

- Ytves, from Studies in Revolution

Ytves is the author of Studies in Revolution during the Final Empire. His book is recalled by Elend during the Siege of Luthadel. It found that rebellions against the Lord Ruler often fizzled out on their own because people were unsure how to govern themselves after having known only the Lord Ruler's dictatorship.</description>

      <description>Walin is a prisoner at the Pits of Hathsin on Scadrial.

He was sent to the Pits as punishment for trying to steal food from his plantation master.

Like most prisoners in the Pits he has many long cuts on his arms. He was barely fed, his fingers kept searching for geodes instinctively and he was too tired to care about entering the mists or getting beaten. Walin usually climbed up to sleep, but then he had to look out for younger, stronger men who would attack him to steal his atium geode. He wasn't sure if such a life was better than being dead.

Walin is freed by Kelsier, who was about to destroy the mines, just after he managed to find an atium geode the final day of the week. Although he first thinks that Kelsier wants to steal his geode, after being encouraged by Kelsier, he leaves the Pits to sell the atium to secure his freedom.</description>

The shades can only be combated with silver, which makes the metal an incredibly valuable resource on the planet.</description>

      <description>Words of Radiance is a book discussing the Knights Radiant. It contains a chapter for each of their orders, with talk of their traditions, their abilities, and their attitudes. It was written two hundred years after the Recreance. By the author's own admission, a lot of the book's content is hearsay, incorporating facts, lore, and superstition. The original writing was done in an old dialect of Alethi, using the protoscript, a precursor to the modern women's script.

Tinalar possessed a Shardblade, but no Shardplate. Considering the young Adolin Kholin to be merely a well-dressed fop, Tinalar dueled him for Shards, hoping to embarrass Adolin's father, Dalinar Kholin, and win Adolin's Plate. However, Adolin won the duel and claimed Tinalar's Shardblade as his own. Tinalar's Blade is the same one that Adolin later came to know as Mayalaran.</description>

      <description>Yix is a member of Macob's caravan.

He has golden hair and is likely of Iriali descent. He is potentially multilingual, though it is unknown which languages he speaks. He wears tan clothing and carries a sword, though unlike in Vorin society, this is not necessarily indicative of his rank. He is a highly suspicious person and good at moving stealthily.

He works under Tyn while travelling with Macob's caravan across the Frostlands and performed duties as a scout. Yix and Tyn found Shallan and Tvlakv spying on their camp after the caravan had fled a group of bandits. It is likely that Yix died defending the caravan when it was attacked a second time by the bandits.</description>

      <description>Voidspren are spren that, instead of being connected to either Honor or Cultivation, are under Odium's control. They are similar to other types of spren in many ways, such as their ability to bond with things in the Physical Realm and their various shapes and habits. However, these spren fight on the opposite side of the Desolations, aiding Odium's goal to destroy the Rosharans and ultimately earn his freedom from Braize. Once they were entrapped by the Oathpact, the Voidspren would torture the Heralds present on Braize in an attempt to get them to bend the bars of Damnation and release them back to Roshar.</description>

      <description>The Widow's Trial is a mourning ceremony in Arelon, created before the Reod.

A recent widow is expected to perform some type of charitable act. The effort and time the widow expends on her trial represents how much she valued her husband and their marriage. Typically widows give food or other necessities to the poor. Sarene utilizes the Widow's Trial to undermine Hrathen's attempt to demonize the Elantrians by taking food to them, and encourages other nobles to accompany her. It originated from the religious surrounding the Elantrians, so it is considered a pagen ritual. However, Sarene's priest as well as many other followers Shu-Korath consider it a perfectly fine ritual as it only involved giving to those who need it rather than actually worshipping Elantrians.</description>

"You will find wise men in any religion, Shallan, and good men in every nation. Those who truly seek wisdom are those who will acknowledge the virtue in their adversaries and who will learn from those who disabuse them of error. All others - heretic, Vorin, Ysperist, or Maakian - are equally closed-minded"

The Velding is a location on Sel which is being spied upon by Teod. King Eventeo had not been able to get any spies there in a month, and worried what the Fjordell planned there.

It is possible the Velding is a place in Fjorden, but it could be located in any place in the Fjordell Empire. Or, it could be a place outside of the Empire, but of interest to the Fjordell.</description>

      <description>Winds is an Eelakin working for Northern Interests Trading Company on First of the Sun.

Winds was a member of the Patji expedition. He traveled with the company on their ship to the island of Patji in the Pantheon and stayed in the main fortress that the expedition constructed. While Vathi, one of the leaders of the expedition went to scout a site for a second camp, Winds stayed at the fortress. He and some of the others opened up one of the machines that the Eelakin had gotten from the Ones Above when one of their number died on First of the Sun. They hoped to learn how the machine functioned.

When Vathi and Sixth of the Dusk arrived at the fortress after crossing the island during the night, Vathi told Winds to turn off the machine that they had gotten from the Ones Above. Winds told Vathi that they had not turned on the machine. Vathi believed Winds to be lying to her, but he then explained to her that they had merely opened it.</description>

They are native to the isles of the Pantheon, including Patji. Tuskrun are nearly the size of humans and hunt in packs, primarily during the day. They follow predictable movement patterns unless they are attracted by the blooming of one of Patji's Fingers. It is possible that they are omnivorous, as tuskrun make mounds while rooting around in the ground.

The trapper First of the Sky was killed by a tuskrun pack on Patji that had been attracted by Patji's Fingers.</description>

      <description>William Montane is the late husband of Silence Montane, and father of William Ann Montane.

Little is known about William Montane. It seems likely that he works at Silence's waystop when it is run by Silence's grandmother. Silence becomes pregnant by William shortly before his death, although it is uncertain how he died. It also appears that he and Silence are never married legally, although she takes his surname. Silence's grandmother considers him to be a fool and an idiot for believing that the shades and the Evil are punishments from the God Beyond. When Silence gives birth to her daughter, she names the girl William Ann, after her father. William Ann takes after her father in appearance.

After William's death, his shade is said to guard Silence's waystop against enemies, although it is possible that this legend was started by Silence herself.</description>

      <description>Tobias is one of Stephen Leeds' aspects.

He is a lanky, dark-skinned old man with white hair who is an expert on history and trivia. He tends to ramble on about things and has been coined a walking Wikipedia. Stephen seems to find his voice quite comforting.

His insanity is that he hallucinates about an astronaut named Stan in space who lives on a satellite, who occasionally sends him weather information. Stan is not one of Stephen's hallucinations, but is Tobias'. Stephen also mentions that Tobias has schizophrenia.

Tobias dies from a stab wound inflicted by a nightmare version of Armando. This has a strange effect on Stephen, causing him to forget things like the Eiffel Tower.</description>

It was also the fansite of other authors up to that time, such as Dan Wells and Howard Tayler. It was initially set up as a means of communication between Brandon and various other friends, and wasn't repaired in 2011 due to the availability of other software such as Facebook.

The one given to Kairominas takes the form of the piece of slate.

The underbloods are a group of people in Newcago; possibly a gang, or servants of some Epic from another city. They seem to be opposed to Steelheart's regime, as Curveball and his underlings fight with them occasionally.

The underbloods kill one of Curveball's men, Eddie Macano, two days before David attempts to blend in by pretending to be on site on orders from Eddie. David isn't aware of that, which blows his cover.</description>

      <description>"His Diggers had cut out several levels of understreets, complete with buildings, and people had flowed to Newcago for work."

- David, about Steelheart

The Understreets are areas in Newcago located "underground"/inside the tunnels carved or otherwise created in steel, into which the ground has been transformed by Steelheart.

The streets vary by depth, some being shallow, with grates opening to the sky, and some too deep for anything but artificial lighting. They were cut into the steel by Diggers. As a result of their subsequent madness, understreets vary by levels. Upper levels have enough space for homes and alternating lighting allowing limited navigation. The lower levels, called the Steel Catacombs, were dug mostly randomly, and are easy to get lost in. Steelheart's police rarely patrolled the understreets and shops had to have people watching them.

Knowing the different colored light patterns allowed for navigation through the upper levels of the understreets. It is common practice to carry a weapon around the understreets.</description>

      <description>Trappers are the hunters and priests of the Pantheon, as well as, until recently, the islands' only inhabitants.

Trappers are trained from a young age on the island of Sori in the many skills necessary for surviving and succeeding on the islands of the Pantheon. Notable skills include knowledge of the deadly flora and fauna on the islands and the breeding of Aviar. Upon completion of this training, the trapper selects one of the islands, on which they will hunt exclusively for the rest of their lives.

Trapper's children are named according to the order they are born, and the time of day. "Sixth of Dusk" is the sixth child in his family, and was born during dusk. However, he later reveals that his name refers to something else: the dusk of his people.

The high demand for Aviar is met solely by this small number of trappers (estimated at "a few dozen" by Vathi), which lead to an attempt at colonization of the islands by Mainlanders.

As technology has progressed, the trappers have taken advantage of this. In stark contrast to their club-bearing, wrap-wearing predecessors, modern trappers use rugged clothing and steel machetes, as well as backpacks and other survival equipment. Trappers usually maintain several safe camps around their chosen island, each of which are heavily booby-trapped. They maintain an aloof rivalry with one another and will lay traps in an attempt to eliminate their competition, but simply ignore one another in a direct encounter. Despite this, trappers keep a short note detailing the locations of their Aviar for another passing trapper should they fall to one of the many dangers of the Pantheon. Compared to their brethren in the Eelakin Islands, trappers maintain much more of their cultural tradition.</description>

Although Brandon no longer sends copies of this version of White Sand to people who request it via email, it is provided via a link in the newsletter to subscribers. He requests that they do not share it or discuss it in a public forum.

The opening sequence of "White Sand" was officially published in the "Arcanum Unbounded" anthology.</description>

Nothing is known of Vax, its peoples, or any Shards that may or may not be located there. All that is certain is that it has a manifestation of Investiture in which people are Initiated differently than on Sel, Scadrial, Nalthis, or Taldain.

On Scadrial, when Ruin is killed by Vin while she is holding Preservation, Ati's soul is finally freed from Ruin and appears in the Cognitive Realm. Right before moving on to the Beyond, Ati looks around Scadrial's subastral and seems to wonder aloud if it is Vax. Leras would recognize Vax.</description>

      <description>"The lass is a bit paranoid, but she’s not that bad. I swear, that man was so jumpy that his own heartbeat could startle him."

- Dockson on Vent

Vent is a skaa who lived in the Final Empire on Scadrial.

Vent knew Kelsier and Dockson. He is an extremely nervous and jumpy man. When Kelsier met Vin, he was reminded of Vent, although Dockson insisted that she was not as bad. As Kelsier and Dockson spoke of Vent in the past tense, it seems likely that he was dead by the point they met Vin.</description>

The metal is from a Shard of Adonalsium currently known in the cosmere but which particular Shard is unknown. The metal is not known to Harmony. The name is in reference to the force currently known only as Trell on Scadrial, and the metal is associated with that "god", theorized to be a Shard.

Trellium is a silvery metal with a red cast to it, and dark red spots similar to rust.</description>

      <description>Tresting plantation is located in the Central Dominance north-west of Luthadel.

The plantation is owned by Themos Tresting and the staff at the plantation included other lords and at least two minor obligators, as well as a number of taskmasters and over two dozen soldiers. His plantation was manned by a workforce of several hundred skaa.

On a certain night Kelsier visited Tresting plantation. He entered one of the skaa hovels, where he talked with Tepper and Mennis and gave them nobleman's food. Then he heard two woman, Jess and her daughter, screaming outside their hovel, Tresting's soldiers where taking the daughter to his manor. Kelsier immediately went to the manor himself, where he killed all the plantation staff, burned down the manor and rescued Jess's daughter.

The plantation skaa then went on their way to join the skaa rebels in the Arguois caverns. Only a few of them actually stayed, the rest joined other plantations.</description>

However, she explains that "those who are quick to give their allegiance are quick to change it." She promises to kill Larcener, but Prof reprimands her, and claims he needs a sample of Larcener's DNA first. Wiper uses her power to short out Megan's illusions when Prof realizes that the Reckoners are in the same room as them.

Wiper is in her early twenties, and wears her blonde hair in a braid. She has the ability to temporarily shut down another Epic's external powers (but not internal ones like defensive or healing powers). As she has no immortality benefits, she is easily killed by David with a simple gunshot.</description>

      <description>The Threnodite system is the planetary system that contains Threnody, where Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell takes place. Though none of the planets in the system have Shards residing on them, the Shards Ambition, Mercy, and Odium fought in the empty space of the system. It is unclear which side Mercy supported, though it seems likely that they were allied to Ambition, since Harmony reached out to them for help against Odium. Ambition was mortally wounded as a result of this clash, and this calamity is at least a partial cause of the twisted forms of Investiture on Threnody. The system contains four planets, one of which has a moon. It is significant that most of the celestial bodies in the system are named after songs of mourning.</description>

"The window was latched with some kind of long bar on the other side, probably fitted into slots across the back of the shutters. Fortunately, these stormshutters weren't as tight as those in other towns; they probably didn't need to be, down here safe in the trenches. She let the vines wind around the branches, drinking of her Stormlight, then twist around her arms and squeeze through cracks in the shutters. The vines stretched up the inside of the shutters, pressing up the bar that held the shutters closed, and...And she was in. She used the last of her awesomeness to coat the hinges of the shutters, so they slid against one another without a hint of a sound. She slipped into a boxlike stone room, lifespren pouring in behind her, dancing in the air like glowing whispermill seeds."

      <description>Uli Da was the original Vessel of the Shard Ambition. She is referred to as female in the first Oathbringer letter sent to Hoid.

She is a Sho Del, one of three races on Yolen, and thus a non-human Vessel. She was present on Yolen at the Shattering of Adonalsium.

After the Shattering, Rayse (Odium) immediately felt threatened by Ambition, eventually finding her in the Threnodite system and clashing with her and Mercy. Although she fought back, she was mortally wounded, leaving "chunks" of her power behind; the struggle warped the entire solar system. Ambition was later Splintered in another location under unknown circumstances. Uli Da's death and the Splintering of Ambition have had effects across the cosmere.

The author of the first Oathbringer letter, presumed to be Edgli (Endowment), expresses contempt for Uli Da and is happy that she was killed.</description>

      <description>Vedelliar is a town in southeastern Alethkar on Roshar. It is near Rathalas, and contains a waystop.

During the Battle at the Rift in, Teleb's scouts claimed to have observed a caravan of traitors, including a Shardbearer, fleeing Rathalas to the east towards Vedelliar and the Unclaimed Hills. Tanalan told Dalinar that the traitor was Torol Sadeas. However, Teleb's scouts had been bribed into giving false information; the caravan was actually a trap laid by Tanalan to lure Dalinar away from the city into an ambush.</description>

      <description>Tshadr is a Thaylen Shardbearer and a highguard who lives in Thaylen City on Roshar during the True Desolation.

Tshadr is a wealthy man who owns a manor. He possesses a suit of Shardplate, and as such is a member of one of the eight Thaylen houses to own Shards.

Tshadr likely received his Shardplate from his father in his youth. By the time of the True Desolation, he serves as a member of the highguard, protecting the Thaylen throne. During the Battle of Thaylen Field, Tshadr's location is initially unknown, with Queen Fen Rnamdi believing he might be in his manor or mustering troops in one of the upper tiers of the city. Hrdalm later informs Adolin that Tshadr is holding Court Square in the fight against Amaram's corrupted soldiers and Odium's forces.

Sometime after the battle in Thaylen City, Tshadr moved to Urithiru. He was the only non-Radiant Shardbearer in the tower when the Fused conquered the tower. Someone, presumably Taravangian, told the invaders which room he was in and the shanay-im were able to kill him and take his Plate without anyone noticing.</description>

      <description>Tifi is an Unkalaki on Roshar related to Kef'ha and Lunamor.

Based on Unkalaki cultural traditions, Tifi was presumably related to his nuatoma Kef'ha. Tifi and Lunamor were both part of a family group that traveled to the Shattered Plains as part of Kef'ha's quest to win Shardplate from Torol Sadeas. However, Sadeas murdered Kef'ha without a proper duel. Lunamor stated that Tifi and Sinaku'a were among those killed after raising weapons in vengeance, likely after Sadeas seized Kef'ha's property and turned his family into servants.

When Tuaka was reunited with Lunamor, she asked after Sinaku'a and Tifi. Her reaction implied that they were Lunamor's older siblings and that their death meant that he had gained elevated status, possibly becoming nuatoma himself. However, Lunamor did not wish to discuss the matter, and Tifi's identity was left ambiguous.</description>

- Taravangian to Mrall

Uscri is a character from a tragic Rosharan poem written around seventeen hundred years before 1174.

In the poem, after hearing that her lover had died, she drowned herself in the sea, although in reality he still lived and she had misunderstood the report. In the following centuries, she was used as an example of acting without information, although over time it came to mean stupid. By modern times, it had become a rather obscure literally reference.

In 1174, Taravangian insulted Mrall by calling him Uscritic. The obscurity of the reference caused Adrotagia to realize that Taravangian had intentionally misrepresented his intelligence on that morning's test, so they would not place restrictions on him.</description>

Vardinar came to know Kaladin as a fellow soldier when Kaladin was investigating Azure's activities during the Siege of Kholinar. Vardinar is not mentioned as part of Noro's squad, but he may have been in the same platoon, since Kaladin knows him by name.

Kaladin tasked him with taking command of two squads from the Eighth Platoon to defend against the Fused during the Battle of Kholinar Palace. Vardinar led the squads to one of the palace's towers to try and use archery against the Fused. Kaladin soon noted that the Fused must have "swept" the tower using Lashings, as injured or dead men were falling to the wall below. It is not known if Vardinar was among the few survivors of the battle.</description>

Hoid saw Vatwha in Kholinar after the Siege of Kholinar, hovering in the air, acting as a sentry. Despite her training to spot Hoid, she gave him barely a glance when he passed underneath her. Hoid decided to not take it as an insult.</description>

- Ved to members of the Kholinar Wall Guard.

Ved is a member of Kholinar Wall Guard.

He is part of Platoon Seven Squad Four. He is, like Beard, well acquainted with Kaladin. Like the rest of their Wall Guard platoon, he is a lighteyes of the tenth dahn, colloquially called tenners by themselves. He and Beard help teach Kaladin what to do in the Kholinar Wall Guard. He helps defend Kholinar when Fused attacked, using a pike with Beard. He follows Kaladin into Kholinar palace for the Battle of Kholinar. Because he is not mentioned afterwards, he probably dies along with the rest of the squad.</description>

- From drawer 12-15, ruby, in the Urithiru gem archive

Wzmal is a man mentioned in one of the records in the Urithiru gem archive. It is likely due to his naming structure that he is Thaylen.

His wife was planning to depart Urithiru and was given the opportunity to leave a message. She chose to leave a record of her family. A ruby was used to record the message, so she was likely a Dustbringer.

She felt Wzmal was as good a man as any woman could dream of loving.</description>

When a tenasi diplomatic vessel arrived at Earth to investigate cytonic "squeaks" that came through the Phone Company's early cyto system, the United Governments military accidentally shot it down with a single missile. The Phone Company stepped in and brokered the Tenasi Agreement, negotiating peace in exchange for being placed above the law. It is unknown if the United Governments military still exists by the time Jason Write decides to reveal faster-than-light travel in 2211, but the United Governments still exists and grants patents.</description>

She's the mother of Arturo, and her family lives in the deep caverns. The Mendezes owns three private fighters that are used as escorts during trading operations. These ships are not accessible to the DDF during times of need as they are primarily reserved to evacuate the Mendez family if they are in danger. They have a private radio frequency, 1250, as well as a private radio that is able to unscramble the pilot frequencies.</description>

      <description>Dr. Thior is a doctor and the head of Alta Base medical for the Defiant Defense Force.

She is an advocate for pilot mental health and in her role as head of medical pushes for, and successfully implements, initiatives such as counseling and mandatory leave for pilots after the loss of flight members. Cobb agrees with Dr. Thior's overall sentiment, as well as some of her suggestions, however, he believes that she doesn't fully understand what is and isn't helpful for grieving pilots. Overall, he thinks of her as a good person.

Dr. Thior does not believe that the defect exists and has strongly advocated against the removal of Spensa from Flight School based on the brain readings taken using the probes in Spensa's helmet. Dr. Thior has offered alternative explanations for these readings, however, it is not currently known what alternatives she has suggested. She is supported strongly by Jorgen's father Algernon Weight, as well as other political figures. On Ironsides' orders, Dr. Halbeth -- a proponent of the defect -- condemns Dr. Thior's explanations of Spensa's readings.

After the death of their teammate, Hurl, Dr. Thior orders the members of Skyward Flight to take a weeks worth of medical leave. Additionally, after being tipped off that Spensa was being denied the right to food and accomodation at Alta Base, Dr. Thior caused a commotion, leading Ironsides to remove the restrictions that had been placed on Spensa, giving her full cadet privileges. It is likely that Cobb was the one who tipped off Dr. Thior.</description>

      <description>Vici Cavern is a human-inhabited cavern on Detritus.

They are descendants from marines of Defiant, and are rumored to be great warriors. They have a separate culture and mostly keep to themselves.

Morningtide is a Vician. English is not her first language, which may mean the Vician's are also not English speakers. Additionally, they may have a distinct accent from those that live in other caverns. Spensa also noted that she had a tattoo across her jaw that seemed to identify her as Vician.</description>

      <description>The Yeong-Gwang was a ship in the old fleet which carried humanity to Detritus.

The residents and descendants are known as Yeongian, and are mostly ethnically Chinese or Korean.

After landing, they formed a clan and used their hydroponics knowledge to become underground farmers in a cavern close to Igneous. The food grown by this clan is of high value and is only available to those who have multiple achievement or industry merits. Bim is from that clan.</description>

      <description>Callsign Tunestone is a member of Nightmare Flight along with Nose, Bog, Sushi, Jager, and Nord. She has a high pitched voice and comes across as dismissive.

Tunestone, along with her flight mates, accompanied Skyward Flight in a routine mission to tag debris. Paired with FM and Spensa, Tunestone and her wingmate Bog attempted to show off their light-lance skills, assuming the cadets to not be overly familiar with the manoeuvres. Neither of the cadets found the display overly impressive, and in turn they demonstrated their own competency using a light-lance. Later, when the group were attacked by Krell ships, Tunestone was ordered by her flightleader, Nose, to fly defensively and keep an eye out for Lifebusters until reinforcements arrived.

Later, Nightmare Flight participated in the Battle of Alta Second.</description>

      <description>The Unicarn Skirmish is one of the four major DDF battles that helped secure independence for the United Defiant Caverns. It occurred early in the DDF's history and was the first time the DDF used second-generation starfighters in battle. These ships were built in secret in Igneous Cavern, however, it is unknown if they were built specifically for this battle.

One of the questions on the Flight School exam Spensa takes asks a question which she thinks would be difficult, because the Unicarn Skirmish is less well known than the others.</description>

      <description>A zinkall, plural zinkallin, is a ranged weapon used by Daysiders on Taldain. They are powered by air pressure. A zinkall looks like a set of thin reed-like pipes held together with rope mounted on the forearm, near the wrist. Each tube contains a small arrow, that can be launched by the wielder of the zinkall by pulling a trigger above the pipes, releasing the air and firing the arrow. The arrows are made from sandling carapace and usually have green fletching on the back of their shafts. The exact range of a zinkall is unknown. Zinkallin are common weapons on Dayside. They are seen used by Kerztian warrior-priests, Lossandin trackts, and members of Sharezan's gang. Tain gives Ais a defective zinkall before luring her into a trap.</description>

      <description>Wulfden the First is a former Wyrn of the Fjordell Empire on Sel.

Wulfden the First lived over three hundred years before the Reod, during the First Empire of Fjorden. The empire had conquered almost all of Opelon through military might, but collapsed due to its rapid expansion.

Fjorden originally had a pantheistic religion, but after the collapse, Wulfden converted to Shu-Dereth and made it the state religion of Fjorden, elevating Jaddeth from a minor god to a primary deity. Early Derethi leadership, presumably under Wulfden's guidance, also instituted the system of propaganda that led their priests to alter historical works such as Wyrn the King.

Within a generation, all of Fjorden was Derethi, and the militaristic structure of their society was adapted to an aggressive policy of religious conversion of neighboring states. The resulting Fjordell Empire, also known as the "New Empire", eventually gained more power than the First Empire had once held.</description>

      <description>Wyrn is an ancient resident of Sel who founded the nation of Fjorden. Subsequent rulers of Fjorden have used "Wyrn" as a title.

He is the subject of the oldest known literary work on Sel, Wyrn the King. He lived long before the founding of Shu-Dereth and Shu-Korath. After Shu-Dereth was adopted as the state religion of Fjorden, modern Derethi priests altered historical documents to falsely claim that Wyrn was Derethi and worshipped Jaddeth.

He is said to have wielded a sword named Gretgor. A sword thought to be Gretgor is still extant and held in Widor.</description>

      <description>The Val is a class of starfighter used by scout teams in the DDF.

Val-class fighters are not heavily armed, as they are designed for scanner avoidance and speed. They have a single 131 Stewart destructor; larger ships carry as many as four destructors, often using the more powerful 138 Stewart model. The scanning sensors on the Val-class have a longer range and are more sensitive to detail than those used on other DDF ships.

The members of Ranger Flight fly Val-class ships.</description>

The Flight was called up from reserve to provide backup and take over from Skyward Flight during a battle. Before Victory Flight arrived, the group of cadets were attacked and forced to engage the enemy. Victory Flight arrived moments before Hurl lost control of her Poco and crashed, believing that she could safely land the broken ship. Victory Flight took over the fight allowing the remaining members of Skyward Flight to pull out of the battle and retreat.</description>

Trell is a mysterious entity worshiped by followers of Trellism on Scadrial. Trell is also the name of the deity worshiped by followers of Trelagism, though it is unclear to what extent these beings are related. Trell became a force of opposition against Harmony sometime after the Catacendre.</description>

The UrDail are a nation of aliens that live on the planet ReDawn. They are not a part of the Superiority and have allied with the humans in the past. It's unknown whether "UrDail" is also the name of their species or if they have a different word for themselves.</description>

      <description>"We will stop this from going further, Cuna. We’ll resist Winzik. Clean up his mess."

- Zezin to Cuna

Zezin is a figment who serves Minister Cuna in the Superiority.

Zezin uses a variety of scents to portray their emotions, including wet soil to indicate anger and rotting fruit for sorrow and anguish.

Zezin did not initially believe Cuna, when they suggested that Winzik would attempt to summon a delver, and were shocked and angry when Starsight was set upon by one of the beings. Despite the situation at hand, Zenzin did not believe that Winzik intended for the delver to assault the space station, or that he was using it to destroy the Superiority government for his own gain. Cuna urges Zenzin to escape Starsight without them as they would be unable to keep up with the figment. Before departing, Zenzin promised Cuna that they will continue to resist Winzik and try to rectify the situation.</description>

      <description>"[Humans] are aggressive, yes, but not on the level of, say, a cormax drone or the wrexians."

- Sssizme

The wrexians are a species or people known to the Superiority.

Very little is known about them; not what they look like, where they come from or whether they are some sort of client or member of the Superiority. What is known is that they're extremely aggressive, more so than humanity, and they apparently cannot be "domesticated" the way some humans have been by the Superiority officials. However, they have much less cytonics users than humans, and are neither as industrious nor as quick to spread.</description>

      <description>Vahnn is a varvax ambassador sent to Evensong. Two weeks before Jason Write arrives at Evensong to retrieve Denise Carlson, he disappears; around the time Jason arrives, a large piece of carapace is found in a burning station and he is presumed dead.

After retrieving Denise and noticing her mannerisms seem more in line with those of a varvax than a human, Jason realizes that someone used cytonics to swap Vahnn's mind with that of Denise, leaving his mind in her body and her mind in his body. Thinking the humans are attempting to infiltrate varvax society to learn cytonics, Jason concludes that something must have gone wrong with the swap, resulting in Vahnn's body being disposed of in the burning station and Denise being left to wander the streets, where she was found by local authorities and checked into a mental health treatment ward. After Edmund tells him about how the varvax treat their discontents, however, he realizes that Vahnn swapped into Denise's body in an attempt to gain access to advanced human technology.

When Jason returns to the Phone Company's Central Operations on Earth, he takes Vahnn—still in Denise's body—with him, where the varvax discontent is questioned by PC operatives.</description>

      <description>"The allusions… Such wordplay… The momentum and rhetoric… This is a work of art."

- Reactions from the viziers to Verdict

Verdict is an essay written by Jasnah Kholin in the year 1174. It is one of three arguments presented to the Azish Government by the Urithiru Coalition in an attempt to get the central Rosharan Empire to join their forces.

Verdict is the shortest essay of the three, being only a single, double sided, page long. It is written entirely in single rhythmic meter and includes references to Aqqu's seven Logical Forms and the Grand Orientation. It also contains a quote by Prime Kasimarlix that is used to extrapolate to different levels of Superior Understanding, in three sequential stages.

The essay was presented to the Azish viziers and scions by Dalinar Kholin, in an effort to convince the country to join the Coalition against Odium and the Fused. It was final essay to be presented and convinced Vizier Noura to at least consider the alliance offer and present the arguments to the Prime. Verdict was received favorably by the officials and they were highly impressed by Jasnah's writing, finding it to live up to her reputation as a scholar. Nevertheless, it was not Jasnah's essay, but Navani's, that eventually convinced the Azish to join the Coalition.</description>

      <description>(Zinc) Brand Whiskey is a brand of whiskey on Scadrial that was advertised in The New Ascendancy broadsheet. It is distilled exclusively in the Outer Cities and is not sold in Elendel. One of its primary selling points is that it does not pass through Elendel and is therefore not taxed by its government. This allows residents of the Outer Cities, among whom dislike of the taxation and oppression of Elendel is common, to purchase the drink knowing that their purchase will not be supporting that regime.</description>

- Adolin’s describing the Tukari

The Tukari caravaneers are a group of mercenaries who are active in the southern area of the Sea of Souls and are known to attack spren. There are more than twenty members in the group, and the leader wears a blue-on-yellow-patterned overcoat. It is possible the group are employed by Ishar and have been tasked to bring him spren bodies that he can use in his experiments.</description>

      <description>The Tukari caravan leader is part of a group of mercenaries who are active in the southern area of the Sea of Souls and are known to attack spren. He supervises more than twenty men. It is possible the Tukari caravan leader is working for Ishar and has been tasked to bring him spren bodies that the Herald can use in his experiments.

The Tukari caravan leader is likely ethnically Makabaki, with brown skin and black hair, and wears clothing from the southeastern makabak region, including a blue-on-yellow patterned overcoat. His features may be hard to make out, likely due to some supernatural means.{[book ref|sa4|30}} He may have some level of formal military or battle training.

The Tukari leader is one of the men who attacked Notum after he went south on his patrol. When Adolin came to Notum’s rescue, the Tukari leader stood back from the fighting and gave orders to the other men in his group. His leadership kept his group of mercenaries fighting after Adolin’s first attack, instead of the other men being scared off by their opponent. The leader eventually lost control over his men when Maya joined the battle. Adolin attempted to attack the Tukari leader, after dodging the leader's bodyguard, however, the Tukari leader dodged at the last moment and only received a gash along his shoulder. After being injured, the leader, along with his remaining men retreated to their caravan before departing the area.</description>

After the fourth and last of the Sibling's nodes in Urithiru was destroyed, Raboniel sent a guard to tell the Word of Deeds and the Night Known to come to her. She presumably sought their help in completing the Sibling's corruption.</description>

      <description>The Tower Guard is a security force in Urithiru on Roshar.

The Tower Guard was presumably created by the coalition of monarchs at some point after the Battle of Narak. When Urithiru was invaded by singers, Queen Navani asked after Commander Lyon of the Tower Guard when she was strategizing about how to defend the tower. She was informed that Lyon was one of the Radiants that had fallen unconscious due to Raboniel's partial corruption of the tower's defenses.</description>
